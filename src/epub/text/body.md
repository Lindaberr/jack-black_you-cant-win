## Chapter I

I am now librarian of the *San Francisco Call*.

Do I look like one? I turn my chair so I can look
in the mirror. I don’t see the face of a librarian.
There is no smooth, high, white forehead. I do not
see the calm, placid, composed countenance of the
student. The forehead I see is high enough, but it is
lined with furrows that look like knife scars. There
are two vertical furrows between my eyes that make
me appear to be wearing a continual scowl. My eyes
are wide enough apart and not small, but they are
hard, cold, calculating. They are blue, but of that
shade of blue farthest removed from the violet.

My nose is not long, not sharp. Nevertheless it is
an inquisitive nose. My mouth is large—one corner
of it is higher than the other and I appear to be
continually sneering. I do not scowl, I do not sneer; yet
there is something in my face that causes a man or
woman to hesitate before asking to be directed to Dr.
Gordon’s church. I can’t remember a time that any
woman, young or old, ever stopped me on the street
and asked to be directed. Once in a great while a
drunk will roll over to where I am standing and ask
how he can get to “Tw’ninth ’n’ Mission.”

If I gaze into the mirror long enough and think
hard enough I can conjure up another face. The old
one seems to dissolve and in its place I see the face
of a schoolboy—a bright, shining, innocent face. I
see a mop of white hair, a pair of blue eyes, and an
inquisitive nose. I see myself standing on the broad
steps of the Sisters’ Convent School. At the age of
fourteen, after three years’ “board and tuition,” I am
leaving to go home to my father and then to another
school for “big boys.”

My teacher, a sweet, gentle Sister, a madonna, is
holding my hand. She is crying. I must hurry away
or I will be crying, too. The Mother Superior says
good-by. Her thin lips are pressed so tightly together
that I can barely see the line where they meet. She is
looking into my eyes intently and I am wondering what
she is going to say to me when the crunching of gravel
warns us that the old coach is ready and I must be
off. The Mother takes my teacher gently by the hand.
I see them go through the wide door and disappear
silently down the long, dark hall.

All the boys in the school, and there were fifty of
them, lined up and gave me a noisy send-off. The old
coachman clucked to his horses, and I was off for the
train—and the world.

Any reader with a spoonful of imagination can
picture me going home, then to other schools in turn,
then to some sort of an office job; advancement here
and there, always leading a well-ordered, quiet,
studious life, until he finally places me in the respectable
and responsible position of librarian of a metropolitan
newspaper. That’s the way it should have been, but
wasn’t.

The course I followed from that convent school
to this library desk, if charted on a piece of paper,
would look like the zigzag line that statisticians use
to denote the rise and fall of temperature or rainfall or
fluctuations of business. Every turn I made was a
sharp one, a sudden one. In years I cannot remember
making one easy, graceful, rounded turn.

It has often been a question with me just how much
the best of it a boy has, who has his mother with him
until his feet are well planted under him; who has a
home and its influences until he gathers some kind
of a working philosophy that helps him to face the
world. There is no substitute for the home and the
mother.

It may not mean much to the average chap to have
a friend say: “John, I want you to meet my mother.”
To me it means more than I can put on paper. It
seems to explain to me why the man who so proudly
says, “This is my mother,” is so many things that I am
not and never can be. ‘The insurance people have not
yet got to the stage of insuring a man against a
lifetime of failure, but if they ever do, I imagine the chap
who can guarantee them that he will keep his mother
with him until he is twenty will have a shade the best
of it when he pays his premium.

I am not lugging in the fact that I was left
motherless at the age of ten to alibi myself away from
anything. Nevertheless I think a fellow has the right to
ask himself if things might not have been different. My
mother died before I got very well acquainted with
her—I doubt if any child gives its parents much
thought before the age of twelve or thirteen.

I probably thought that my mother was a person
put into the world to scrub my face and neck and to be
screamed and kicked at; to put scratchy, flannel rags
around my neck with smelly grease on them when I had
the croup; and to stand by the bed and keep me in it
when I had the measles. I can remember distinctly
how angry I became when she brought me a nice, new
toothbrush and showed me what to do with it.

This was the greatest indignity of all—the last
straw. I threw the thing away and refused to use
it; told her up and down that I was “no girl” and
wouldn’t have any “girl things.” She did not get angry
and scold; she just went on with her work, smiling.
She may have been pleased with my manly outburst.
I don’t know.

I don’t remember that I was shocked or pained when
she was buried. I cried, because it was expected of me.
Mother’s relatives, a couple of sisters, whom I never
saw before or since, were crying. I saw tears in my
father’s eyes. So I tried to cry, and did. I know
my father realized what we had lost and his grief was
genuine, but I could not feel it then.

A few days later father sold our little cottage
home and furnishings and we moved into the only
hotel in the little town. Schools were few and far
between for poor children then. I played around the
hotel all day, running wild, till father came home from
work. He would have his dinner, read a paper, and
then put me to bed. After that he would read a
book for an hour and go to bed himself. We lived
this way for almost a year. Some nights he would
put down his book and look at me strangely for
minutes at a time. I was a problem, undoubtedly, and
he was trying to decide what to do with me. A
ten-year-old boy without a mother is a fit problem for any
father’s mind, and my father was a thoughtful man.

Looking back at it, it seems to me that I was blown
here and there like a dead leaf whipped about by the
autumn winds till at last it finds lodgment in some
cozy fence corner. When I left school at fourteen I
was as unsophisticated as a boy could be. I knew no
more of the world and its strange way than the gentle,
saintly woman who taught me my prayers in the
convent.

Before my twentieth birthday, I was in the dock of
a criminal court, on trial for burglary. I was acquitted,
but that is another story. In six years I had deserted
my father and home, gone “on the road.” I had
become a snapper-up of small things, a tapper of tills,
a street-door sneak thief, a prowler of cheap lodging
houses, and at last a promising burglar in a small way.

At twenty-five I was an expert house burglar, a
nighttime prowler, carefully choosing only the best
homes—homes of the wealthy, careless, insured people.
I “made” them in the small hours of the night, always
under arms.

At thirty I was a respected member of the “yegg”
brotherhood, a thief of which little is known. He is
silent, secretive, wary; forever traveling, always a
night “worker.” He shuns the bright lights, seldom
straying far from his kind, never coming to the
surface. Circulating through space with his always-ready
automatic, the yegg rules the underworld of criminals.
At forty I found myself a solitary, capable
journeyman highwayman; an escaped convict, a fugitive, with
a background of twenty-five years in the underworld.

A bleak background! Crowded with robberies,
burglaries, and thefts too numerous to recall. All
manner of crimes against property. Arrests, trials,
acquittals, convictions, escapes. Penitentiaries! I
see in the background four of them. County jails,
workhouses, city prisons, Mounted Police barracks,
dungeons, solitary confinement, bread and water,
hanging up, brutal floggings, and the murderous
straitjacket.

I see hop joints, wine dumps, thieves’ resorts, and
beggars’ hangouts.

Crime followed by swift retribution in one form or
another.

I had very few glasses of wine as I traveled this
route. I rarely saw a woman smile and seldom heard
a song.

In those twenty-five years I took all these things, and
I am going to write about them.

And I am going to write about them as I took them
—with a smile.

## Chapter II

I was a problem to my father, running loose about
the hotel while he was at work, and finally he took me
to a Catholic school one hundred miles away. On that
short trip my father and I got to be good friends, and
I think I was closer to him that day than on any other
of our lives. Father left that evening and told me to
be good, mind the Sisters, and study hard.

I fell into my groove in the school with other boys
of my age. Our days were passed pleasantly with our
small studies, many prayers, and daily attendance at
mass. The food was coarse but wholesome.

I never went home at vacation time. I spent those
days in exploring near-by orchards, gardens, and fields,
picking up fruit, vegetables, and berries, and other
things that help to take the edge off a small boy’s
appetite.

I spent much time about the barns and stables with
Thomas, the coachman. I was an expert listener, a
rare talent, inherited from my father, no doubt.
Thomas was a ready talker. This is a combination
that never fails to make firm and lasting friendships,
and we became friends. He was a veteran of our
Civil War, had been on the losing side, and came out
of it full of hatred, lead, and rheumatism. His heroes
were not Lee or Stonewall Jackson, but Quantrell, the
guerrilla, Jesse and Frank James, Cole and Bob
Younger.

I never tired of listening to his war stories, and
often found myself piecing them together in the
schoolroom when I should have been active with my studies.

I believe I was the only boy at the school who never
went away on holidays and vacations to visit parents
or relatives. The Sister Superior, probably realizing
that my life was a bit too drab, often gave me the
privilege of going to the village for mail and papers.
This was a rare treat, and much sought by all the boys.
It meant a long walk, a stroll down the village street,
a chance to see people, maybe to buy a fat sandwich, a
bag of peanuts, or a bottle of pop—no small things
in a boy’s life. It also meant authority and
responsibility, good things for a boy. I looked forward to
these journeys. I always had a little small silver, for
spending, from my father.

The time passed quickly and pleasantly enough.
I learned many prayers, practiced for singing in the
church choir, and became an altar boy, serving the
priest at mass. I liked learning the prayers and the
Latin responses to the priest, but did not make much
headway with my other studies.

I liked the dear, simple old priest to whom I made
my first confession, and at times thought I would like
some day to be a priest myself. Between my
admiration for old Thomas, the coachman, with his stormy
stories of the war, and my love for the quiet old priest,
my mind was always pulling me this way and that—
whether I should become a priest, or a soldier like
Tommy, limping around with his short leg and his
rheumatism.

One day when I was waiting for the mail I heard
a nice old lady ask the postmaster whose boy I was.

He said, “That’s one of the boys from the convent.
You can tell them a block away. They are all perfect
little gentlemen. They say ‘Please’ and ‘Thank you.’
I do not know how the Sisters do it, but they can surely
bring boys up. I wish I could do it with mine.”

When I returned with the mail I told the Superior
what I heard the postmaster say about her and her
boys. She seemed very much pleased, smiled, and
said: “Boys are good when they are taught to say their
prayers and to fear God.” Shortly after, I was
appointed “mailman.” I went to the village every day
after school. When the weather was fine I walked;
if it was bad, I rode in or on the coach with Tommy.
This was the first and only “appointment” of my life.
I did not think it over then, but I know now I was not
given it because I said “please” or my prayers—I got
it because I had told the Superior the nice things the
postmaster said. “Please” is a good word in its place;
but it does not get one appointed to anything. It has
a proper place in a small boy’s vocabulary. And it
is also much used by a certain class of prisoners and
supplicants who are always “pleasing” somebody and
are never pleasant to anybody.

Your capable beggar on the street does not say
“please.” He rips off his spiel in such exact and precise
language that he gets your dime without it. You so
admire his “art” that you do not miss the “please.”
His is an art. He omits the “please” because he knows
you do not use it except when you want the mustard.

Looking back, it seems to me that our life in the
convent was not properly balanced. We had none of
the rough, boisterous times so dear to the small boy,
no swimming, baseball, football. We were a little too
cloistered, too quiet, too subdued. There was no
wrestling, no boxing, no running and jumping and
squabbling and shuffling and shouldering about. Of
course I learned all those later. But I learned them
quickly, too quickly—all in a bunch. That put me out
of balance again. Those exercises should have been
mixed in with my studies and prayers.

One stormy day I came out of the post office and as
usual handed up the paper to Tommy, whose habit it
was to glance at the headlines and return it to me.
This day, however, he found something that interested
him. He put the horses’ lines between his legs and
crossed his knees on them. I sat beside him on the
box and shivered in the wind. He read on and on,
column after column, then turned to an inner page,
fighting the paper in the wind.

At last, and it seemed an hour, he folded it up
carefully and returned it to me. “Good news to-day,
Tommy?” “No, boy, no good news. Bad news,
awful news, terrible news.” He spoke in an awed
voice, a voice that carried reverence. “Terrible news
—Jesse James has been murdered, murdered in cold
blood and by a traitor.”

He fell silent and spoke to me no more that day.
Later he told me many things about Jesse James. He
worshiped him, and like many other good people of
Missouri firmly believed that neither of the James
boys ever fired a shot except in defense of their rights.

I delivered the mail and hastened to tell the other
boys that Jesse James was dead, “murdered.” Many
of the older boys knew all about him—he was their
hero, too—and the things they told me made me decide
to get the paper and read his story myself. The next
day, strangely enough, I passed the Superior’s office
when she was out to lunch. The paper was folded
neatly, lying on some older papers on the corner of
her neat desk. I walked in and took it. I put it away
carefully, but many days passed before I got to the
reading of it. I was so occupied with my duties as
altar boy, and so busy with preparing for my first
communion and learning new prayers, that the James
boys and all other worldly things had no place in my
mind.

Those were intense days. I lived in another world.

At last I found time to read my paper. On my way
for the mail I slowly dug out the story of Jesse James’
life and death, word by word. How I studied the
picture of this bearded and be-pistoled hero! And the
sketches of his shooting and the house in which it was
done. Then came the story of his bereaved mother.
How my boyish sympathy went out to her, as she wept
for her loss and told the story of the lifelong
persecution of her boys, Jesse and Frank, and how she feared
that the hunted fugitive, Frank James, would also be
dealt with in the same traitorous fashion. How I
loathed the traitor, Bob Ford, one of the James boys
gang, who shot Jesse when his back was turned, for a
reward! How I rejoiced to read that Ford was almost
lynched by friends and admirers of Jesse, and had to
be locked in the strongest jail in the state to protect
him from a mobbing. I finished the story entirely
and wholly in sympathy with the James boys, and all
other hunted, outlawed, and outraged men.

When I had done with the paper I passed it along
to the other boys, who read it and handed it about till
it was finally captured by the Superior. It was limp
and ragged from usage. The Superior promptly
traced it back to me. When asked where I got it, I
told her I had taken it from her desk. I was lectured
severely on the wrong of taking things without asking
for them. I told her I did not ask for it because I was
afraid she might refuse me. She said nothing, and did
not offer to give me any, from which I understood
that we were not to have papers. I was also relieved
of my job as mailman. I was no longer to be trusted.

My teacher heard of my disgrace. She took me
into her study, and we talked the thing over. The loss
of my job was nothing; I would be going home soon,
anyway. I must not feel bad about the lecture, I had
done nothing wrong. I would have returned the
paper, only the other boys wanted to read it. I
discovered that she looked at it the same way I did.

She asked me if I wanted more papers. I was on
fire for papers and told her so. She promised to get
me one every day, and did. When I read it I returned
it to her.

The James boys’ story ran on for days and I
followed it word for word, sympathizing with the hunted
fugitive, Frank, wishing I were old enough and strong
enough to find him and help him escape his pursuers
and avenge his brother’s death.

When that story was over I turned to other crime
stories and read nothing else in the papers. Burglaries,
robberies, murders—I devoured them all, always in
sympathy with the adventurous and chance-taking
criminals. I reconstructed their crimes in my boyish
mind and often pictured myself taking part in them.
I neglected my studies and prayers to rove about in
fancy with such heroes as Jimmy Hope, Max Shinburn,
and “Piano Charlie,” famous “gopher men,” who
tunneled under banks like gophers and carried away their
plunder after months of dangerous endeavor.

Looking back now I can plainly see the influence the
James boys and similar characters had in turning my
thoughts to adventure and later to crime.

## Chapter III

At last the day came for me to go home, for I had
passed my fourteenth birthday and was too old to stay
at the Sisters’ School.

I wanted to kiss my favorite teacher good-by, but
didn’t quite dare do it. So I rode down to the station
with Tommy, who bought me a fifty-cent knife, out of
his salary, only twelve dollars a month, and went away
to join my father.

Father took me back to the same hotel, to the same
room. He had occupied it during the three years I
had been away, and the only change was that he put
a small bed in it for me. Everything was new and
strange to me. Men coming and going all day, eating
and drinking. Everything was noise and bustle, and
it took me a few days to get used to this new life.

I found lots of papers lying around—some cheap
novels, Police Gazettes, etc.—and I read them all,
everything I could get hold of. I saw my father only
at night, and occasionally we would take a walk then
for an hour.

One evening as we were returning from our walk,
we came upon a man whose team of horses was stalled
in a mud hole. He was beating the horses, and cursing
them with the most fearful oaths. I stopped still in
my tracks and began praying for him. Father looked
back, saw me standing still, and said: “What are you
doing, John, listening to that mule skinner swear?”

I finished my prayer and caught up with him.

“You will learn to swear soon enough, John, without
stopping to listen to these teamsters,” he said a little
severely.

In self-defense I told him I was not listening to
the man, but praying for him. “The Sisters taught us
to do that,” I said. “They taught us to pray for all
sinners.”

Father wore a long beard, the custom of his day.
When he was very thoughtful or vexed with some
problem, he had a habit of twisting up the end of his
beard into a pigtail. He would then put the pigtail
between his teeth and chew on it.

After I explained what I had been doing, he looked
at me strangely, twisted up his beard, put the end
in his mouth, and began chewing. He took my hand,
something he never did before, and we walked home
in silence. He went straight upstairs, and I found
some fresh papers, which I read downstairs. When
I went up to go to bed he was sitting in his chair,
staring at the wall and still chewing his beard. My
coming aroused him. He said, “Good night, John,”
and we went to bed.

The next evening he came in as usual. He read his
paper and I read whatever came to my hand. When
we went upstairs, he said: “John, the Sisters taught
you many prayers, did they?” “Yes, sir, all the
prayers. I know them all,” I said proudly.

“How about reading?” he asked. I read him a
piece from a newspaper fairly well.

“And writing, John? Yes, I know you learned to
write and spell. Your letters to me were very good.
How’s your arithmetic, John? How many are eight
times nine, John?”

I was stuck. I hesitated and blushed. He saw my
confusion and gave me an easier one. “Seven times
six, John?”

I was stuck again and got more confused. “Start at
the beginning, John, maybe you can get it that way.”

I started at seven times one, got as far as seven
times four, and fell down. This was torture. I think
he saw it, too, for he said, “Oh, well, John, that will
come to you later. Don’t worry about it; just keep on
trying.”

He was a sharp at mathematics, and I think my
failure to learn multiplication hurt him more than if
he had caught me spelling bird with a “u,” or sugar
with two “gs.” After a month of idleness it was
decided that I should go to the district school, which had
been built in our town while I was at the Sisters’. I got
a new set of books and started bravely off.

We had a woman teacher, very strict, but fair to us
all. I learned rapidly everything but arithmetic, which
did not seem to agree with me, nor does it yet, for that
matter. I also learned to play ball, football, marbles,
and, I must admit, hooky, the most fascinating of all
small-boy games. These new games, and so many
other interesting new things, soon crowded the prayers
into the background of my mind, but not entirely out
of it. I said them no more at night and morning, nor
any other time. But I still remember them, and I
believe now, after forty prayerless years, I could muster
a passable prayer if the occasion required it and there
were not so many people about who could do it so much
better.

After school, having no chores to do, I loitered
around the hotel office. One day I found a dime novel
entitled, “The James Boys.” I seized upon it and
devoured it. After that I was always on the lookout
for dime novels. I found a place where they were sold.
I would buy one and trade with some other boy when
it was read. If I could not trade it, I took it back
to the store and the woman gave me a five-cent one
for it. The nickel one was just as thrilling, but
shorter. I read them all. “Old Sleuth,” “Cap Collier,”
“Frank Reade,” “Kit Carson.” Father saw me with
them, but never bothered me. One day he brought
me one of Fenimore Cooper’s Leatherstocking tales.
I read it and was cured of the five- and ten-cent novels.

Between going to school and to the depot in the
evening to see the train come in, and hanging around
the hotel bar watching the town’s celebrated ones,
especially the “bad men” who had killed or shot
somebody somewhere some time, I put in fairly busy days.
The time flew.

I got to be quite looked up to by the other boys of
my age. I “lived at the hotel,” had “nobody to boss
me around,” didn’t have to “run errands and chop
kindling and go after the groceries and carry milk.”
When a new boy showed up, I was the one to show him
around. I remember distinctly, now, that in less than
a year after I left the Sisters, I was going down the
street with a new boy when we came upon one of the
town drunkards and bad men. I pointed him out with
pride. “See that old fellow? That’s old Beverly
Shannon. He’s been out to Leadville. He killed a
man out there and nearly got hung. You ought to
hear him swear when he gets drunk and falls down and
nobody will help him up.”

There was admiration in my voice. Our town was
full of bad men. All had been in the war on one side
or the other. Everybody had a pistol or two, and a
shotgun or a rifle. Everybody knew how to use them.
No small boy’s outfit was complete without a pistol.
Usually it was a rusty old “horse pistol,” a
cap-and-ball affair, some old relic of the Civil War. By a great
stroke of fortune I got two of them. I was helping
an old lady to move some things out of her cellar when
we ran across them in a trunk.

“Lord, Lord,” she said, “are those awful things
here yet? I thought they had been thrown away
years ago. Johnnie, take them out and bury them
somewhere. Throw them away so I will never see
them again.”

These two old pistols made me feel important,
established. I began to look about me. It was time
I began to be somebody. My latest hero was the
man that kept the bar in the hotel. He owned the
building, leased the hotel, and ran the bar himself.
He was a fat man, and he wore a fancy striped vest
with a heavy gold watch chain across it and a
twenty-dollar gold piece dangled from the chain for a charm.
He had been out to California. It was the only
twenty-dollar piece in the town. He was a small politician,
the town fixer. When anybody got into any trouble
and had to go before the justice of the peace, he went
down to the hotel and saw “Cy” Near. Cy would
say, “Leave it to me, that’s all, leave it to me.” When
it was all over the fellow would come down to “Cy’s”
and order drinks for everybody in sight, several times.
Then he would say, “What do I owe you, Cy?”

“Owe me? Owe me for what?”

“Why, you know, Cy, for fixing up that little 
trouble.”

“Oh, that’s what you mean. Say, you don’t owe
me a thin dime, not a greasy nickel.” Cy would wave
a fat arm in the air. “I don’t take money for helping
my friends. I sell licker, good licker; that’s my
business.”

The chap would buy a few more rounds of drinks,
thank Cy again, and start for the door. Cy would
shout, “Hey, George, I forgot to tell you. I’m rafflin’
off a hoss an’ buggy and you’d better take a half dozen
tickets. You stand to win a good rig.”

Around election time Cy would round up all the
fellows he could, remind them that he had befriended
them, and say, “What do we care who’s President of
the United States? What we want is a decent justice
of the peace and town marshal.”

I decided to pattern my life after Cy’s. He was a
popular, successful man. I began swinging my arms
about, talking in a loud, hoarse voice, wearing my hat
on the back of my head. Cy smoked big cigars. I
tried one, and gave up the notion of smoking, at least
for a while.

It was not long till my fancy for the saloon keeper
changed. One evening when the train came in a
single traveler got off. He was a tall, lean man, who
walked like a soldier, erect and with a confident step.
He had a short, stubby, gray mustache. He wore a
gray suit, a gray hat, and held a pair of gloves in his
hand. He walked quickly toward the front of the
train and waited by the baggage car till a trunk was
tossed out. An express man near by was told to take
the trunk over to the hotel.

I followed the gray man to the hotel. Presently
the trunk was left in front and I went to inspect it. It
was a leather trunk, with brass fittings, plastered over
with stickers from many hotels and steamship lines.
It was scratched and battered and travel-stained. The
thing fascinated me. I stood around and felt it,
read the stickers, some of them from foreign parts of
the world, and wondered what kind of man he could be
that possessed such a wonderful trunk.

I was restless and disturbed when the porter took
it upstairs out of my sight. It had roused strange
thoughts and longings in my mind that I did not
understand then. I know now that it suggested travel,
adventure by land and sea—the world.

I now pulled my hat down from the back of my
head and wore it properly. I straightened up, kept
my hands out of my pockets, walked with a quick step,
and assumed a confident, positive manner. I even
began to think about a mustache, bristly, cut down like
the gray man’s. I must have a gray suit, gray hat,
gloves, and a leather trunk. A big problem for a boy
with no income.

I determined to earn some money and looked about
for after-school work. After my father, I thought the
saloon man, Cy, was the wisest man in our town. For
some reason which I never could figure out, I did not
submit the matter to my father, but went to the saloon
man. Maybe it was because he was easier to talk to.
We went over the situation carefully. There was no
job in sight that either of us could think of. At last
Cy said, “Well, if you’re so crazy about a job, I’ll
make one for you.”

Cy was a bachelor, and lived in a single room in the
hotel. He opened and closed his bar, did all the work,
was always drinking, but no one ever saw him drunk.

“You can come in here in the morning before school
and clean the place up. Sweeping out ain’t no man’s
job, anyway, and I’m tired of it. You can wash up
the glasses and dust up around the bar. In the
afternoon when you come home from school, you can be
around in case there’s any errands. At night you can
look after the pool table, collect for the games, and
see that they don’t steal the balls. You can serve the
drinks when there’s a card game, and bring a new
deck when some sore loser tears the old one up.”

I was so grateful to Cy that I gave him my very
best “thank you.” Here was a chance to get on in
life, to have my own money, and be independent and
mix around with men—to learn something of the
world. I was so taken with this notion that I hunted
up the broom, which was worn down to the strings,
and began sweeping out the barroom. There were no
customers in the place. Cy stood by, his hat on one
side of his head, a big cigar in the opposite side of his
mouth, hands in pockets, and eyed me thoughtfully.
When I had the place about half swept out, Cy came
over and took the broom out of my hands. He turned
it about, examined it carefully. “Johnnie, I think
you’re on the square with me, and I’m going to be on
the up and up with you. You go to the store and get
yourself a new broom.”

I did that, and swept the place all over again.
Having started to work without my father’s permission I
decided to say nothing till I got well settled in my job.
I had a feeling that he might veto the whole thing if
I told him at the start, but if I waited a while and had
a few dollars saved up he might let me continue.

Father knew Cy very well. On rare occasions he
went into the bar and had a drink and a talk with him.

I worked faithfully, early and late. At the end of
the week, in the afternoon when there was no customer
about, Cy mysteriously beckoned me into his “office,”
a small closet of a room at one end of the bar. It was
simply furnished—a table, a chair, a large spittoon,
one picture on the wall opposite the desk. A picture
of the mighty John L. Sullivan in fighting pose. Cy
seated himself at the table, put on a pair of glasses,
and drew out a small notebook. He looked carefully
about the room. Seeing the door of his office open, he
told me to close it.

To me Cy had always been much of a mystery. He
had been “out West”—to Leadville, Deadwood, and
San Francisco. He owned the latest pattern of
repeating rifle and a couple of “forty-fives.” He played
poker. I thought I was now to be initiated into some
of the secret activities of his life. Maybe he would
ask me to do something dangerous. Well, whatever,
it was, I would do it. He wrote something in the
notebook, then took three silver dollars out of his
pocket and put them in my hand, carefully, without
clinking them.

“Johnnie, this is pay day.”

I went back to work happy. Pay day, three dollars
of my own money. I would have a gray suit, gray hat,
gloves, and a leather trunk in no time. I would soon
be a tall, handsome, distinguished-looking gentleman,
on Cy’s money. I jingled my three dollars loudly and
could hardly wait for my father to come home so I
could tell him about my working and ask him to mind
my money for me.

The possession of three dollars changed me at once.
I became independent, confident, secure. When father
came in I went to him without a single misgiving,
feeling sure he would approve. I had my money in my
hand and my spirit was high. I told him I had been
working for Mr. Near all week; that I had three
dollars in wages and wanted him to take care of them
for me. He took the money and put it in his pocket,
saying: “All right. Let me know when you want it.”

“And you don’t mind my working for Cy?”

“No. I don’t mind. Cy told me all about it.
You will have to learn to work some time. And you
will have to learn lots of other things. So you may
as well start at Cy’s.”

He turned to his paper, and I thought the thing was
settled, but as I went out of the room I saw him
twisting up the end of his long beard.

The school work was no trouble to me. I put in a
year, and vacation time came along almost before I
knew it. I was saving all the money I earned as
assistant to Cy, and was looking forward to earning
more during vacation. I brought home to my father a
report from the school which seemed to show that
I had made good progress. He glanced at the card
and threw it to one side.

“I suppose you have the multiplication table this
time, John?”

“Oh, yes, I learned it at last.”

“How many are eight times nine, John?”

“Seventy-two, sir.”

“Good. Seven times six?”

“Forty-two, sir.”

“Correct, John.” 

He did not seem to be much interested in my correct
and prompt answers; kept on looking at his paper.
Finally he looked at me and said: “And eight times
thirteen, John?”

I was stuck again. This one froze me stiff. I got
mad, red in the face. I took pencil and paper out of
my pockets, figured it out, and give him the result. It
seemed that he was taking advantage of me. Nobody
at school had ever asked me that question. I felt
wronged. I thought of my money and my two big
horse pistols. If I was to be treated in this way I
would take my money and pistols and go away where
I could get a square deal. And if I did not get a
square deal, I’d take it.

Father looked at the paper I gave him. “Why, you
have it right, John. That’s good, very good.” He
was stroking his beard thoughtfully, and I could not
tell whether he was smiling or making a face.

Vacation was almost over. I needed new books for
the coming season and spoke to father about them one
night.

“Never mind them now. We will see about them
later. We are going away, going to Kansas City. I
have been promoted after all these years.”

“But I will lose my job,” I demurred.

“I’ll get you another job. Don’t worry. Do you
want a regular job, working all day, or would you
like to go to school some more?”

I decided to have an all-day job, and let the school
go.

“All right,” he said, “we’ll see about it.”

My father made no fuss about leaving the small
town where he had spent ten years of his life. He had
no close friends or cronies. After my mother died, he
seldom spoke to any one but me, and I think he was
glad to go away. He was a cold, hard, silent
Scotch-Irishman. He took no part in social doings, never
went to church, belonged to no clubs; nor was he
enough interested in politics to become a citizen and
exercise the high privilege of voting on election day.

My good-bys did not take much time. Cy was sorry
to have me go. He laboriously wrote me a fine letter
of recommendation which he gave me along with a
large, worn silver watch, that wound with a key. It
weighed almost a pound, and I was proportionately
proud of it. My boy friends envied me in going away
to a big city and impressed upon me the necessity for
taking my pistols with me. Unnecessary advice; I had
no intention of leaving them behind.

And last of all I hunted up old Beverly Shannon, the
bad man. He was a hooknosed old man with hard
eyes and a long chin whisker dripping tobacco juice.
He had worn the Northern blue, and drew a small
pension for a “bad leg.” Times when he was half
drunk, limping around town in search of more drinks,
some one would say: “Look out, ‘Bev.’ You’re limpin’
on the wrong leg.” This always brought a string of
eloquent curses from him, and a warning that they
had “better be keerful. I hain’t stopped killin’ jest
’cause Abe Lincoln says the war’s over.”

In those days all roads led to the harness shop, and
there “old Bev” was always to be found when
sober, outside the shop on a bench under a tree. There
he met all the droughty farmers and entertained them
with war stories and tales of his wanderings “out
West.” He was always invited to drink with them.
His pension kept him in food. His life held no serious
problem.

I found him on his bench, sober and sorry for it.
He passed the time of day with me, and I told him I
was going away and had come to say good-by.

“Goin’ to the city, huh? Well, don’t let ’em rub
it into you. You ain’t a very strong boy.” He was a
foxy old man. He leered at me out of his cunning
eyes. “Have you got any shootin’ irons?” Long
John Silver, the pirate, could not have done any better
in the way of complimenting a boy. I was fairly
hooked. I assured him that I was well heeled, having
two pistols.

“That’s good. You’ll git along all right. Now you
run along. I’ve got to git me a farmer. I ain’t had
my whisky yet.”

I hastily dug up enough silver out of my small
pocket money for a couple of drinks, and gave it to
him. As I went away I thought he looked like an old
spider watching his web for a fly.
