## Chapter I

I am now librarian of the *San Francisco Call*.

Do I look like one? I turn my chair so I can look
in the mirror. I don’t see the face of a librarian.
There is no smooth, high, white forehead. I do not
see the calm, placid, composed countenance of the
student. The forehead I see is high enough, but it is
lined with furrows that look like knife scars. There
are two vertical furrows between my eyes that make
me appear to be wearing a continual scowl. My eyes
are wide enough apart and not small, but they are
hard, cold, calculating. They are blue, but of that
shade of blue farthest removed from the violet.

My nose is not long, not sharp. Nevertheless it is
an inquisitive nose. My mouth is large—one corner
of it is higher than the other and I appear to be
continually sneering. I do not scowl, I do not sneer; yet
there is something in my face that causes a man or
woman to hesitate before asking to be directed to Dr.
Gordon’s church. I can’t remember a time that any
woman, young or old, ever stopped me on the street
and asked to be directed. Once in a great while a
drunk will roll over to where I am standing and ask
how he can get to “Tw’ninth ’n’ Mission.”

If I gaze into the mirror long enough and think
hard enough I can conjure up another face. The old
one seems to dissolve and in its place I see the face
of a schoolboy—a bright, shining, innocent face. I
see a mop of white hair, a pair of blue eyes, and an
inquisitive nose. I see myself standing on the broad
steps of the Sisters’ Convent School. At the age of
fourteen, after three years’ “board and tuition,” I am
leaving to go home to my father and then to another
school for “big boys.”

My teacher, a sweet, gentle Sister, a madonna, is
holding my hand. She is crying. I must hurry away
or I will be crying, too. The Mother Superior says
good-by. Her thin lips are pressed so tightly together
that I can barely see the line where they meet. She is
looking into my eyes intently and I am wondering what
she is going to say to me when the crunching of gravel
warns us that the old coach is ready and I must be
off. The Mother takes my teacher gently by the hand.
I see them go through the wide door and disappear
silently down the long, dark hall.

All the boys in the school, and there were fifty of
them, lined up and gave me a noisy send-off. The old
coachman clucked to his horses, and I was off for the
train—and the world.

Any reader with a spoonful of imagination can
picture me going home, then to other schools in turn,
then to some sort of an office job; advancement here
and there, always leading a well-ordered, quiet,
studious life, until he finally places me in the respectable
and responsible position of librarian of a metropolitan
newspaper. That’s the way it should have been, but
wasn’t.

The course I followed from that convent school
to this library desk, if charted on a piece of paper,
would look like the zigzag line that statisticians use
to denote the rise and fall of temperature or rainfall or
fluctuations of business. Every turn I made was a
sharp one, a sudden one. In years I cannot remember
making one easy, graceful, rounded turn.

It has often been a question with me just how much
the best of it a boy has, who has his mother with him
until his feet are well planted under him; who has a
home and its influences until he gathers some kind
of a working philosophy that helps him to face the
world. There is no substitute for the home and the
mother.

It may not mean much to the average chap to have
a friend say: “John, I want you to meet my mother.”
To me it means more than I can put on paper. It
seems to explain to me why the man who so proudly
says, “This is my mother,” is so many things that I am
not and never can be. ‘The insurance people have not
yet got to the stage of insuring a man against a
lifetime of failure, but if they ever do, I imagine the chap
who can guarantee them that he will keep his mother
with him until he is twenty will have a shade the best
of it when he pays his premium.

I am not lugging in the fact that I was left
motherless at the age of ten to alibi myself away from
anything. Nevertheless I think a fellow has the right to
ask himself if things might not have been different. My
mother died before I got very well acquainted with
her—I doubt if any child gives its parents much
thought before the age of twelve or thirteen.

I probably thought that my mother was a person
put into the world to scrub my face and neck and to be
screamed and kicked at; to put scratchy, flannel rags
around my neck with smelly grease on them when I had
the croup; and to stand by the bed and keep me in it
when I had the measles. I can remember distinctly
how angry I became when she brought me a nice, new
toothbrush and showed me what to do with it.

This was the greatest indignity of all—the last
straw. I threw the thing away and refused to use
it; told her up and down that I was “no girl” and
wouldn’t have any “girl things.” She did not get angry
and scold; she just went on with her work, smiling.
She may have been pleased with my manly outburst.
I don’t know.

I don’t remember that I was shocked or pained when
she was buried. I cried, because it was expected of me.
Mother’s relatives, a couple of sisters, whom I never
saw before or since, were crying. I saw tears in my
father’s eyes. So I tried to cry, and did. I know
my father realized what we had lost and his grief was
genuine, but I could not feel it then.

A few days later father sold our little cottage
home and furnishings and we moved into the only
hotel in the little town. Schools were few and far
between for poor children then. I played around the
hotel all day, running wild, till father came home from
work. He would have his dinner, read a paper, and
then put me to bed. After that he would read a
book for an hour and go to bed himself. We lived
this way for almost a year. Some nights he would
put down his book and look at me strangely for
minutes at a time. I was a problem, undoubtedly, and
he was trying to decide what to do with me. A
ten-year-old boy without a mother is a fit problem for any
father’s mind, and my father was a thoughtful man.

Looking back at it, it seems to me that I was blown
here and there like a dead leaf whipped about by the
autumn winds till at last it finds lodgment in some
cozy fence corner. When I left school at fourteen I
was as unsophisticated as a boy could be. I knew no
more of the world and its strange way than the gentle,
saintly woman who taught me my prayers in the
convent.

Before my twentieth birthday, I was in the dock of
a criminal court, on trial for burglary. I was acquitted,
but that is another story. In six years I had deserted
my father and home, gone “on the road.” I had
become a snapper-up of small things, a tapper of tills,
a street-door sneak thief, a prowler of cheap lodging
houses, and at last a promising burglar in a small way.

At twenty-five I was an expert house burglar, a
nighttime prowler, carefully choosing only the best
homes—homes of the wealthy, careless, insured people.
I “made” them in the small hours of the night, always
under arms.

At thirty I was a respected member of the “yegg”
brotherhood, a thief of which little is known. He is
silent, secretive, wary; forever traveling, always a
night “worker.” He shuns the bright lights, seldom
straying far from his kind, never coming to the
surface. Circulating through space with his always-ready
automatic, the yegg rules the underworld of criminals.
At forty I found myself a solitary, capable
journeyman highwayman; an escaped convict, a fugitive, with
a background of twenty-five years in the underworld.

A bleak background! Crowded with robberies,
burglaries, and thefts too numerous to recall. All
manner of crimes against property. Arrests, trials,
acquittals, convictions, escapes. Penitentiaries! I
see in the background four of them. County jails,
workhouses, city prisons, Mounted Police barracks,
dungeons, solitary confinement, bread and water,
hanging up, brutal floggings, and the murderous
straitjacket.

I see hop joints, wine dumps, thieves’ resorts, and
beggars’ hangouts.

Crime followed by swift retribution in one form or
another.

I had very few glasses of wine as I traveled this
route. I rarely saw a woman smile and seldom heard
a song.

In those twenty-five years I took all these things, and
I am going to write about them.

And I am going to write about them as I took them
—with a smile.

## Chapter II

I was a problem to my father, running loose about
the hotel while he was at work, and finally he took me
to a Catholic school one hundred miles away. On that
short trip my father and I got to be good friends, and
I think I was closer to him that day than on any other
of our lives. Father left that evening and told me to
be good, mind the Sisters, and study hard.

I fell into my groove in the school with other boys
of my age. Our days were passed pleasantly with our
small studies, many prayers, and daily attendance at
mass. The food was coarse but wholesome.

I never went home at vacation time. I spent those
days in exploring near-by orchards, gardens, and fields,
picking up fruit, vegetables, and berries, and other
things that help to take the edge off a small boy’s
appetite.

I spent much time about the barns and stables with
Thomas, the coachman. I was an expert listener, a
rare talent, inherited from my father, no doubt.
Thomas was a ready talker. This is a combination
that never fails to make firm and lasting friendships,
and we became friends. He was a veteran of our
Civil War, had been on the losing side, and came out
of it full of hatred, lead, and rheumatism. His heroes
were not Lee or Stonewall Jackson, but Quantrell, the
guerrilla, Jesse and Frank James, Cole and Bob
Younger.

I never tired of listening to his war stories, and
often found myself piecing them together in the
schoolroom when I should have been active with my studies.

I believe I was the only boy at the school who never
went away on holidays and vacations to visit parents
or relatives. The Sister Superior, probably realizing
that my life was a bit too drab, often gave me the
privilege of going to the village for mail and papers.
This was a rare treat, and much sought by all the boys.
It meant a long walk, a stroll down the village street,
a chance to see people, maybe to buy a fat sandwich, a
bag of peanuts, or a bottle of pop—no small things
in a boy’s life. It also meant authority and
responsibility, good things for a boy. I looked forward to
these journeys. I always had a little small silver, for
spending, from my father.

The time passed quickly and pleasantly enough.
I learned many prayers, practiced for singing in the
church choir, and became an altar boy, serving the
priest at mass. I liked learning the prayers and the
Latin responses to the priest, but did not make much
headway with my other studies.

I liked the dear, simple old priest to whom I made
my first confession, and at times thought I would like
some day to be a priest myself. Between my
admiration for old Thomas, the coachman, with his stormy
stories of the war, and my love for the quiet old priest,
my mind was always pulling me this way and that—
whether I should become a priest, or a soldier like
Tommy, limping around with his short leg and his
rheumatism.

One day when I was waiting for the mail I heard
a nice old lady ask the postmaster whose boy I was.

He said, “That’s one of the boys from the convent.
You can tell them a block away. They are all perfect
little gentlemen. They say ‘Please’ and ‘Thank you.’
I do not know how the Sisters do it, but they can surely
bring boys up. I wish I could do it with mine.”

When I returned with the mail I told the Superior
what I heard the postmaster say about her and her
boys. She seemed very much pleased, smiled, and
said: “Boys are good when they are taught to say their
prayers and to fear God.” Shortly after, I was
appointed “mailman.” I went to the village every day
after school. When the weather was fine I walked;
if it was bad, I rode in or on the coach with Tommy.
This was the first and only “appointment” of my life.
I did not think it over then, but I know now I was not
given it because I said “please” or my prayers—I got
it because I had told the Superior the nice things the
postmaster said. “Please” is a good word in its place;
but it does not get one appointed to anything. It has
a proper place in a small boy’s vocabulary. And it
is also much used by a certain class of prisoners and
supplicants who are always “pleasing” somebody and
are never pleasant to anybody.

Your capable beggar on the street does not say
“please.” He rips off his spiel in such exact and precise
language that he gets your dime without it. You so
admire his “art” that you do not miss the “please.”
His is an art. He omits the “please” because he knows
you do not use it except when you want the mustard.

Looking back, it seems to me that our life in the
convent was not properly balanced. We had none of
the rough, boisterous times so dear to the small boy,
no swimming, baseball, football. We were a little too
cloistered, too quiet, too subdued. There was no
wrestling, no boxing, no running and jumping and
squabbling and shuffling and shouldering about. Of
course I learned all those later. But I learned them
quickly, too quickly—all in a bunch. That put me out
of balance again. Those exercises should have been
mixed in with my studies and prayers.

One stormy day I came out of the post office and as
usual handed up the paper to Tommy, whose habit it
was to glance at the headlines and return it to me.
This day, however, he found something that interested
him. He put the horses’ lines between his legs and
crossed his knees on them. I sat beside him on the
box and shivered in the wind. He read on and on,
column after column, then turned to an inner page,
fighting the paper in the wind.

At last, and it seemed an hour, he folded it up
carefully and returned it to me. “Good news to-day,
Tommy?” “No, boy, no good news. Bad news,
awful news, terrible news.” He spoke in an awed
voice, a voice that carried reverence. “Terrible news
—Jesse James has been murdered, murdered in cold
blood and by a traitor.”

He fell silent and spoke to me no more that day.
Later he told me many things about Jesse James. He
worshiped him, and like many other good people of
Missouri firmly believed that neither of the James
boys ever fired a shot except in defense of their rights.

I delivered the mail and hastened to tell the other
boys that Jesse James was dead, “murdered.” Many
of the older boys knew all about him—he was their
hero, too—and the things they told me made me decide
to get the paper and read his story myself. The next
day, strangely enough, I passed the Superior’s office
when she was out to lunch. The paper was folded
neatly, lying on some older papers on the corner of
her neat desk. I walked in and took it. I put it away
carefully, but many days passed before I got to the
reading of it. I was so occupied with my duties as
altar boy, and so busy with preparing for my first
communion and learning new prayers, that the James
boys and all other worldly things had no place in my
mind.

Those were intense days. I lived in another world.

At last I found time to read my paper. On my way
for the mail I slowly dug out the story of Jesse James’
life and death, word by word. How I studied the
picture of this bearded and be-pistoled hero! And the
sketches of his shooting and the house in which it was
done. Then came the story of his bereaved mother.
How my boyish sympathy went out to her, as she wept
for her loss and told the story of the lifelong
persecution of her boys, Jesse and Frank, and how she feared
that the hunted fugitive, Frank James, would also be
dealt with in the same traitorous fashion. How I
loathed the traitor, Bob Ford, one of the James boys
gang, who shot Jesse when his back was turned, for a
reward! How I rejoiced to read that Ford was almost
lynched by friends and admirers of Jesse, and had to
be locked in the strongest jail in the state to protect
him from a mobbing. I finished the story entirely
and wholly in sympathy with the James boys, and all
other hunted, outlawed, and outraged men.

When I had done with the paper I passed it along
to the other boys, who read it and handed it about till
it was finally captured by the Superior. It was limp
and ragged from usage. The Superior promptly
traced it back to me. When asked where I got it, I
told her I had taken it from her desk. I was lectured
severely on the wrong of taking things without asking
for them. I told her I did not ask for it because I was
afraid she might refuse me. She said nothing, and did
not offer to give me any, from which I understood
that we were not to have papers. I was also relieved
of my job as mailman. I was no longer to be trusted.

My teacher heard of my disgrace. She took me
into her study, and we talked the thing over. The loss
of my job was nothing; I would be going home soon,
anyway. I must not feel bad about the lecture, I had
done nothing wrong. I would have returned the
paper, only the other boys wanted to read it. I
discovered that she looked at it the same way I did.

She asked me if I wanted more papers. I was on
fire for papers and told her so. She promised to get
me one every day, and did. When I read it I returned
it to her.

The James boys’ story ran on for days and I
followed it word for word, sympathizing with the hunted
fugitive, Frank, wishing I were old enough and strong
enough to find him and help him escape his pursuers
and avenge his brother’s death.

When that story was over I turned to other crime
stories and read nothing else in the papers. Burglaries,
robberies, murders—I devoured them all, always in
sympathy with the adventurous and chance-taking
criminals. I reconstructed their crimes in my boyish
mind and often pictured myself taking part in them.
I neglected my studies and prayers to rove about in
fancy with such heroes as Jimmy Hope, Max Shinburn,
and “Piano Charlie,” famous “gopher men,” who
tunneled under banks like gophers and carried away their
plunder after months of dangerous endeavor.

Looking back now I can plainly see the influence the
James boys and similar characters had in turning my
thoughts to adventure and later to crime.
