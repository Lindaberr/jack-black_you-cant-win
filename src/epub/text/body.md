## Chapter I

I am now librarian of the *San Francisco Call*.

Do I look like one? I turn my chair so I can look
in the mirror. I don’t see the face of a librarian.
There is no smooth, high, white forehead. I do not
see the calm, placid, composed countenance of the
student. The forehead I see is high enough, but it is
lined with furrows that look like knife scars. There
are two vertical furrows between my eyes that make
me appear to be wearing a continual scowl. My eyes
are wide enough apart and not small, but they are
hard, cold, calculating. They are blue, but of that
shade of blue farthest removed from the violet.

My nose is not long, not sharp. Nevertheless it is
an inquisitive nose. My mouth is large—one corner
of it is higher than the other and I appear to be
continually sneering. I do not scowl, I do not sneer; yet
there is something in my face that causes a man or
woman to hesitate before asking to be directed to Dr.
Gordon’s church. I can’t remember a time that any
woman, young or old, ever stopped me on the street
and asked to be directed. Once in a great while a
drunk will roll over to where I am standing and ask
how he can get to “Tw’ninth ’n’ Mission.”

If I gaze into the mirror long enough and think
hard enough I can conjure up another face. The old
one seems to dissolve and in its place I see the face
of a schoolboy—a bright, shining, innocent face. I
see a mop of white hair, a pair of blue eyes, and an
inquisitive nose. I see myself standing on the broad
steps of the Sisters’ Convent School. At the age of
fourteen, after three years’ “board and tuition,” I am
leaving to go home to my father and then to another
school for “big boys.”

My teacher, a sweet, gentle Sister, a madonna, is
holding my hand. She is crying. I must hurry away
or I will be crying, too. The Mother Superior says
good-by. Her thin lips are pressed so tightly together
that I can barely see the line where they meet. She is
looking into my eyes intently and I am wondering what
she is going to say to me when the crunching of gravel
warns us that the old coach is ready and I must be
off. The Mother takes my teacher gently by the hand.
I see them go through the wide door and disappear
silently down the long, dark hall.

All the boys in the school, and there were fifty of
them, lined up and gave me a noisy send-off. The old
coachman clucked to his horses, and I was off for the
train—and the world.

Any reader with a spoonful of imagination can
picture me going home, then to other schools in turn,
then to some sort of an office job; advancement here
and there, always leading a well-ordered, quiet,
studious life, until he finally places me in the respectable
and responsible position of librarian of a metropolitan
newspaper. That’s the way it should have been, but
wasn’t.

The course I followed from that convent school
to this library desk, if charted on a piece of paper,
would look like the zigzag line that statisticians use
to denote the rise and fall of temperature or rainfall or
fluctuations of business. Every turn I made was a
sharp one, a sudden one. In years I cannot remember
making one easy, graceful, rounded turn.

It has often been a question with me just how much
the best of it a boy has, who has his mother with him
until his feet are well planted under him; who has a
home and its influences until he gathers some kind
of a working philosophy that helps him to face the
world. There is no substitute for the home and the
mother.

It may not mean much to the average chap to have
a friend say: “John, I want you to meet my mother.”
To me it means more than I can put on paper. It
seems to explain to me why the man who so proudly
says, “This is my mother,” is so many things that I am
not and never can be. ‘The insurance people have not
yet got to the stage of insuring a man against a
lifetime of failure, but if they ever do, I imagine the chap
who can guarantee them that he will keep his mother
with him until he is twenty will have a shade the best
of it when he pays his premium.

I am not lugging in the fact that I was left
motherless at the age of ten to alibi myself away from
anything. Nevertheless I think a fellow has the right to
ask himself if things might not have been different. My
mother died before I got very well acquainted with
her—I doubt if any child gives its parents much
thought before the age of twelve or thirteen.

I probably thought that my mother was a person
put into the world to scrub my face and neck and to be
screamed and kicked at; to put scratchy, flannel rags
around my neck with smelly grease on them when I had
the croup; and to stand by the bed and keep me in it
when I had the measles. I can remember distinctly
how angry I became when she brought me a nice, new
toothbrush and showed me what to do with it.

This was the greatest indignity of all—the last
straw. I threw the thing away and refused to use
it; told her up and down that I was “no girl” and
wouldn’t have any “girl things.” She did not get angry
and scold; she just went on with her work, smiling.
She may have been pleased with my manly outburst.
I don’t know.

I don’t remember that I was shocked or pained when
she was buried. I cried, because it was expected of me.
Mother’s relatives, a couple of sisters, whom I never
saw before or since, were crying. I saw tears in my
father’s eyes. So I tried to cry, and did. I know
my father realized what we had lost and his grief was
genuine, but I could not feel it then.

A few days later father sold our little cottage
home and furnishings and we moved into the only
hotel in the little town. Schools were few and far
between for poor children then. I played around the
hotel all day, running wild, till father came home from
work. He would have his dinner, read a paper, and
then put me to bed. After that he would read a
book for an hour and go to bed himself. We lived
this way for almost a year. Some nights he would
put down his book and look at me strangely for
minutes at a time. I was a problem, undoubtedly, and
he was trying to decide what to do with me. A
ten-year-old boy without a mother is a fit problem for any
father’s mind, and my father was a thoughtful man.

Looking back at it, it seems to me that I was blown
here and there like a dead leaf whipped about by the
autumn winds till at last it finds lodgment in some
cozy fence corner. When I left school at fourteen I
was as unsophisticated as a boy could be. I knew no
more of the world and its strange way than the gentle,
saintly woman who taught me my prayers in the
convent.

Before my twentieth birthday, I was in the dock of
a criminal court, on trial for burglary. I was acquitted,
but that is another story. In six years I had deserted
my father and home, gone “on the road.” I had
become a snapper-up of small things, a tapper of tills,
a street-door sneak thief, a prowler of cheap lodging
houses, and at last a promising burglar in a small way.

At twenty-five I was an expert house burglar, a
nighttime prowler, carefully choosing only the best
homes—homes of the wealthy, careless, insured people.
I “made” them in the small hours of the night, always
under arms.

At thirty I was a respected member of the “yegg”
brotherhood, a thief of which little is known. He is
silent, secretive, wary; forever traveling, always a
night “worker.” He shuns the bright lights, seldom
straying far from his kind, never coming to the
surface. Circulating through space with his always-ready
automatic, the yegg rules the underworld of criminals.
At forty I found myself a solitary, capable
journeyman highwayman; an escaped convict, a fugitive, with
a background of twenty-five years in the underworld.

A bleak background! Crowded with robberies,
burglaries, and thefts too numerous to recall. All
manner of crimes against property. Arrests, trials,
acquittals, convictions, escapes. Penitentiaries! I
see in the background four of them. County jails,
workhouses, city prisons, Mounted Police barracks,
dungeons, solitary confinement, bread and water,
hanging up, brutal floggings, and the murderous
straitjacket.

I see hop joints, wine dumps, thieves’ resorts, and
beggars’ hangouts.

Crime followed by swift retribution in one form or
another.

I had very few glasses of wine as I traveled this
route. I rarely saw a woman smile and seldom heard
a song.

In those twenty-five years I took all these things, and
I am going to write about them.

And I am going to write about them as I took them
—with a smile.

## Chapter II

I was a problem to my father, running loose about
the hotel while he was at work, and finally he took me
to a Catholic school one hundred miles away. On that
short trip my father and I got to be good friends, and
I think I was closer to him that day than on any other
of our lives. Father left that evening and told me to
be good, mind the Sisters, and study hard.

I fell into my groove in the school with other boys
of my age. Our days were passed pleasantly with our
small studies, many prayers, and daily attendance at
mass. The food was coarse but wholesome.

I never went home at vacation time. I spent those
days in exploring near-by orchards, gardens, and fields,
picking up fruit, vegetables, and berries, and other
things that help to take the edge off a small boy’s
appetite.

I spent much time about the barns and stables with
Thomas, the coachman. I was an expert listener, a
rare talent, inherited from my father, no doubt.
Thomas was a ready talker. This is a combination
that never fails to make firm and lasting friendships,
and we became friends. He was a veteran of our
Civil War, had been on the losing side, and came out
of it full of hatred, lead, and rheumatism. His heroes
were not Lee or Stonewall Jackson, but Quantrell, the
guerrilla, Jesse and Frank James, Cole and Bob
Younger.

I never tired of listening to his war stories, and
often found myself piecing them together in the
schoolroom when I should have been active with my studies.

I believe I was the only boy at the school who never
went away on holidays and vacations to visit parents
or relatives. The Sister Superior, probably realizing
that my life was a bit too drab, often gave me the
privilege of going to the village for mail and papers.
This was a rare treat, and much sought by all the boys.
It meant a long walk, a stroll down the village street,
a chance to see people, maybe to buy a fat sandwich, a
bag of peanuts, or a bottle of pop—no small things
in a boy’s life. It also meant authority and
responsibility, good things for a boy. I looked forward to
these journeys. I always had a little small silver, for
spending, from my father.

The time passed quickly and pleasantly enough.
I learned many prayers, practiced for singing in the
church choir, and became an altar boy, serving the
priest at mass. I liked learning the prayers and the
Latin responses to the priest, but did not make much
headway with my other studies.

I liked the dear, simple old priest to whom I made
my first confession, and at times thought I would like
some day to be a priest myself. Between my
admiration for old Thomas, the coachman, with his stormy
stories of the war, and my love for the quiet old priest,
my mind was always pulling me this way and that—
whether I should become a priest, or a soldier like
Tommy, limping around with his short leg and his
rheumatism.

One day when I was waiting for the mail I heard
a nice old lady ask the postmaster whose boy I was.

He said, “That’s one of the boys from the convent.
You can tell them a block away. They are all perfect
little gentlemen. They say ‘Please’ and ‘Thank you.’
I do not know how the Sisters do it, but they can surely
bring boys up. I wish I could do it with mine.”

When I returned with the mail I told the Superior
what I heard the postmaster say about her and her
boys. She seemed very much pleased, smiled, and
said: “Boys are good when they are taught to say their
prayers and to fear God.” Shortly after, I was
appointed “mailman.” I went to the village every day
after school. When the weather was fine I walked;
if it was bad, I rode in or on the coach with Tommy.
This was the first and only “appointment” of my life.
I did not think it over then, but I know now I was not
given it because I said “please” or my prayers—I got
it because I had told the Superior the nice things the
postmaster said. “Please” is a good word in its place;
but it does not get one appointed to anything. It has
a proper place in a small boy’s vocabulary. And it
is also much used by a certain class of prisoners and
supplicants who are always “pleasing” somebody and
are never pleasant to anybody.

Your capable beggar on the street does not say
“please.” He rips off his spiel in such exact and precise
language that he gets your dime without it. You so
admire his “art” that you do not miss the “please.”
His is an art. He omits the “please” because he knows
you do not use it except when you want the mustard.

Looking back, it seems to me that our life in the
convent was not properly balanced. We had none of
the rough, boisterous times so dear to the small boy,
no swimming, baseball, football. We were a little too
cloistered, too quiet, too subdued. There was no
wrestling, no boxing, no running and jumping and
squabbling and shuffling and shouldering about. Of
course I learned all those later. But I learned them
quickly, too quickly—all in a bunch. That put me out
of balance again. Those exercises should have been
mixed in with my studies and prayers.

One stormy day I came out of the post office and as
usual handed up the paper to Tommy, whose habit it
was to glance at the headlines and return it to me.
This day, however, he found something that interested
him. He put the horses’ lines between his legs and
crossed his knees on them. I sat beside him on the
box and shivered in the wind. He read on and on,
column after column, then turned to an inner page,
fighting the paper in the wind.

At last, and it seemed an hour, he folded it up
carefully and returned it to me. “Good news to-day,
Tommy?” “No, boy, no good news. Bad news,
awful news, terrible news.” He spoke in an awed
voice, a voice that carried reverence. “Terrible news
—Jesse James has been murdered, murdered in cold
blood and by a traitor.”

He fell silent and spoke to me no more that day.
Later he told me many things about Jesse James. He
worshiped him, and like many other good people of
Missouri firmly believed that neither of the James
boys ever fired a shot except in defense of their rights.

I delivered the mail and hastened to tell the other
boys that Jesse James was dead, “murdered.” Many
of the older boys knew all about him—he was their
hero, too—and the things they told me made me decide
to get the paper and read his story myself. The next
day, strangely enough, I passed the Superior’s office
when she was out to lunch. The paper was folded
neatly, lying on some older papers on the corner of
her neat desk. I walked in and took it. I put it away
carefully, but many days passed before I got to the
reading of it. I was so occupied with my duties as
altar boy, and so busy with preparing for my first
communion and learning new prayers, that the James
boys and all other worldly things had no place in my
mind.

Those were intense days. I lived in another world.

At last I found time to read my paper. On my way
for the mail I slowly dug out the story of Jesse James’
life and death, word by word. How I studied the
picture of this bearded and be-pistoled hero! And the
sketches of his shooting and the house in which it was
done. Then came the story of his bereaved mother.
How my boyish sympathy went out to her, as she wept
for her loss and told the story of the lifelong
persecution of her boys, Jesse and Frank, and how she feared
that the hunted fugitive, Frank James, would also be
dealt with in the same traitorous fashion. How I
loathed the traitor, Bob Ford, one of the James boys
gang, who shot Jesse when his back was turned, for a
reward! How I rejoiced to read that Ford was almost
lynched by friends and admirers of Jesse, and had to
be locked in the strongest jail in the state to protect
him from a mobbing. I finished the story entirely
and wholly in sympathy with the James boys, and all
other hunted, outlawed, and outraged men.

When I had done with the paper I passed it along
to the other boys, who read it and handed it about till
it was finally captured by the Superior. It was limp
and ragged from usage. The Superior promptly
traced it back to me. When asked where I got it, I
told her I had taken it from her desk. I was lectured
severely on the wrong of taking things without asking
for them. I told her I did not ask for it because I was
afraid she might refuse me. She said nothing, and did
not offer to give me any, from which I understood
that we were not to have papers. I was also relieved
of my job as mailman. I was no longer to be trusted.

My teacher heard of my disgrace. She took me
into her study, and we talked the thing over. The loss
of my job was nothing; I would be going home soon,
anyway. I must not feel bad about the lecture, I had
done nothing wrong. I would have returned the
paper, only the other boys wanted to read it. I
discovered that she looked at it the same way I did.

She asked me if I wanted more papers. I was on
fire for papers and told her so. She promised to get
me one every day, and did. When I read it I returned
it to her.

The James boys’ story ran on for days and I
followed it word for word, sympathizing with the hunted
fugitive, Frank, wishing I were old enough and strong
enough to find him and help him escape his pursuers
and avenge his brother’s death.

When that story was over I turned to other crime
stories and read nothing else in the papers. Burglaries,
robberies, murders—I devoured them all, always in
sympathy with the adventurous and chance-taking
criminals. I reconstructed their crimes in my boyish
mind and often pictured myself taking part in them.
I neglected my studies and prayers to rove about in
fancy with such heroes as Jimmy Hope, Max Shinburn,
and “Piano Charlie,” famous “gopher men,” who
tunneled under banks like gophers and carried away their
plunder after months of dangerous endeavor.

Looking back now I can plainly see the influence the
James boys and similar characters had in turning my
thoughts to adventure and later to crime.

## Chapter III

At last the day came for me to go home, for I had
passed my fourteenth birthday and was too old to stay
at the Sisters’ School.

I wanted to kiss my favorite teacher good-by, but
didn’t quite dare do it. So I rode down to the station
with Tommy, who bought me a fifty-cent knife, out of
his salary, only twelve dollars a month, and went away
to join my father.

Father took me back to the same hotel, to the same
room. He had occupied it during the three years I
had been away, and the only change was that he put
a small bed in it for me. Everything was new and
strange to me. Men coming and going all day, eating
and drinking. Everything was noise and bustle, and
it took me a few days to get used to this new life.

I found lots of papers lying around—some cheap
novels, Police Gazettes, etc.—and I read them all,
everything I could get hold of. I saw my father only
at night, and occasionally we would take a walk then
for an hour.

One evening as we were returning from our walk,
we came upon a man whose team of horses was stalled
in a mud hole. He was beating the horses, and cursing
them with the most fearful oaths. I stopped still in
my tracks and began praying for him. Father looked
back, saw me standing still, and said: “What are you
doing, John, listening to that mule skinner swear?”

I finished my prayer and caught up with him.

“You will learn to swear soon enough, John, without
stopping to listen to these teamsters,” he said a little
severely.

In self-defense I told him I was not listening to
the man, but praying for him. “The Sisters taught us
to do that,” I said. “They taught us to pray for all
sinners.”

Father wore a long beard, the custom of his day.
When he was very thoughtful or vexed with some
problem, he had a habit of twisting up the end of his
beard into a pigtail. He would then put the pigtail
between his teeth and chew on it.

After I explained what I had been doing, he looked
at me strangely, twisted up his beard, put the end
in his mouth, and began chewing. He took my hand,
something he never did before, and we walked home
in silence. He went straight upstairs, and I found
some fresh papers, which I read downstairs. When
I went up to go to bed he was sitting in his chair,
staring at the wall and still chewing his beard. My
coming aroused him. He said, “Good night, John,”
and we went to bed.

The next evening he came in as usual. He read his
paper and I read whatever came to my hand. When
we went upstairs, he said: “John, the Sisters taught
you many prayers, did they?” “Yes, sir, all the
prayers. I know them all,” I said proudly.

“How about reading?” he asked. I read him a
piece from a newspaper fairly well.

“And writing, John? Yes, I know you learned to
write and spell. Your letters to me were very good.
How’s your arithmetic, John? How many are eight
times nine, John?”

I was stuck. I hesitated and blushed. He saw my
confusion and gave me an easier one. “Seven times
six, John?”

I was stuck again and got more confused. “Start at
the beginning, John, maybe you can get it that way.”

I started at seven times one, got as far as seven
times four, and fell down. This was torture. I think
he saw it, too, for he said, “Oh, well, John, that will
come to you later. Don’t worry about it; just keep on
trying.”

He was a sharp at mathematics, and I think my
failure to learn multiplication hurt him more than if
he had caught me spelling bird with a “u,” or sugar
with two “gs.” After a month of idleness it was
decided that I should go to the district school, which had
been built in our town while I was at the Sisters’. I got
a new set of books and started bravely off.

We had a woman teacher, very strict, but fair to us
all. I learned rapidly everything but arithmetic, which
did not seem to agree with me, nor does it yet, for that
matter. I also learned to play ball, football, marbles,
and, I must admit, hooky, the most fascinating of all
small-boy games. These new games, and so many
other interesting new things, soon crowded the prayers
into the background of my mind, but not entirely out
of it. I said them no more at night and morning, nor
any other time. But I still remember them, and I
believe now, after forty prayerless years, I could muster
a passable prayer if the occasion required it and there
were not so many people about who could do it so much
better.

After school, having no chores to do, I loitered
around the hotel office. One day I found a dime novel
entitled, “The James Boys.” I seized upon it and
devoured it. After that I was always on the lookout
for dime novels. I found a place where they were sold.
I would buy one and trade with some other boy when
it was read. If I could not trade it, I took it back
to the store and the woman gave me a five-cent one
for it. The nickel one was just as thrilling, but
shorter. I read them all. “Old Sleuth,” “Cap Collier,”
“Frank Reade,” “Kit Carson.” Father saw me with
them, but never bothered me. One day he brought
me one of Fenimore Cooper’s Leatherstocking tales.
I read it and was cured of the five- and ten-cent novels.

Between going to school and to the depot in the
evening to see the train come in, and hanging around
the hotel bar watching the town’s celebrated ones,
especially the “bad men” who had killed or shot
somebody somewhere some time, I put in fairly busy days.
The time flew.

I got to be quite looked up to by the other boys of
my age. I “lived at the hotel,” had “nobody to boss
me around,” didn’t have to “run errands and chop
kindling and go after the groceries and carry milk.”
When a new boy showed up, I was the one to show him
around. I remember distinctly, now, that in less than
a year after I left the Sisters, I was going down the
street with a new boy when we came upon one of the
town drunkards and bad men. I pointed him out with
pride. “See that old fellow? That’s old Beverly
Shannon. He’s been out to Leadville. He killed a
man out there and nearly got hung. You ought to
hear him swear when he gets drunk and falls down and
nobody will help him up.”

There was admiration in my voice. Our town was
full of bad men. All had been in the war on one side
or the other. Everybody had a pistol or two, and a
shotgun or a rifle. Everybody knew how to use them.
No small boy’s outfit was complete without a pistol.
Usually it was a rusty old “horse pistol,” a
cap-and-ball affair, some old relic of the Civil War. By a great
stroke of fortune I got two of them. I was helping
an old lady to move some things out of her cellar when
we ran across them in a trunk.

“Lord, Lord,” she said, “are those awful things
here yet? I thought they had been thrown away
years ago. Johnnie, take them out and bury them
somewhere. Throw them away so I will never see
them again.”

These two old pistols made me feel important,
established. I began to look about me. It was time
I began to be somebody. My latest hero was the
man that kept the bar in the hotel. He owned the
building, leased the hotel, and ran the bar himself.
He was a fat man, and he wore a fancy striped vest
with a heavy gold watch chain across it and a
twenty-dollar gold piece dangled from the chain for a charm.
He had been out to California. It was the only
twenty-dollar piece in the town. He was a small politician,
the town fixer. When anybody got into any trouble
and had to go before the justice of the peace, he went
down to the hotel and saw “Cy” Near. Cy would
say, “Leave it to me, that’s all, leave it to me.” When
it was all over the fellow would come down to “Cy’s”
and order drinks for everybody in sight, several times.
Then he would say, “What do I owe you, Cy?”

“Owe me? Owe me for what?”

“Why, you know, Cy, for fixing up that little 
trouble.”

“Oh, that’s what you mean. Say, you don’t owe
me a thin dime, not a greasy nickel.” Cy would wave
a fat arm in the air. “I don’t take money for helping
my friends. I sell licker, good licker; that’s my
business.”

The chap would buy a few more rounds of drinks,
thank Cy again, and start for the door. Cy would
shout, “Hey, George, I forgot to tell you. I’m rafflin’
off a hoss an’ buggy and you’d better take a half dozen
tickets. You stand to win a good rig.”

Around election time Cy would round up all the
fellows he could, remind them that he had befriended
them, and say, “What do we care who’s President of
the United States? What we want is a decent justice
of the peace and town marshal.”

I decided to pattern my life after Cy’s. He was a
popular, successful man. I began swinging my arms
about, talking in a loud, hoarse voice, wearing my hat
on the back of my head. Cy smoked big cigars. I
tried one, and gave up the notion of smoking, at least
for a while.

It was not long till my fancy for the saloon keeper
changed. One evening when the train came in a
single traveler got off. He was a tall, lean man, who
walked like a soldier, erect and with a confident step.
He had a short, stubby, gray mustache. He wore a
gray suit, a gray hat, and held a pair of gloves in his
hand. He walked quickly toward the front of the
train and waited by the baggage car till a trunk was
tossed out. An express man near by was told to take
the trunk over to the hotel.

I followed the gray man to the hotel. Presently
the trunk was left in front and I went to inspect it. It
was a leather trunk, with brass fittings, plastered over
with stickers from many hotels and steamship lines.
It was scratched and battered and travel-stained. The
thing fascinated me. I stood around and felt it,
read the stickers, some of them from foreign parts of
the world, and wondered what kind of man he could be
that possessed such a wonderful trunk.

I was restless and disturbed when the porter took
it upstairs out of my sight. It had roused strange
thoughts and longings in my mind that I did not
understand then. I know now that it suggested travel,
adventure by land and sea—the world.

I now pulled my hat down from the back of my
head and wore it properly. I straightened up, kept
my hands out of my pockets, walked with a quick step,
and assumed a confident, positive manner. I even
began to think about a mustache, bristly, cut down like
the gray man’s. I must have a gray suit, gray hat,
gloves, and a leather trunk. A big problem for a boy
with no income.

I determined to earn some money and looked about
for after-school work. After my father, I thought the
saloon man, Cy, was the wisest man in our town. For
some reason which I never could figure out, I did not
submit the matter to my father, but went to the saloon
man. Maybe it was because he was easier to talk to.
We went over the situation carefully. There was no
job in sight that either of us could think of. At last
Cy said, “Well, if you’re so crazy about a job, I’ll
make one for you.”

Cy was a bachelor, and lived in a single room in the
hotel. He opened and closed his bar, did all the work,
was always drinking, but no one ever saw him drunk.

“You can come in here in the morning before school
and clean the place up. Sweeping out ain’t no man’s
job, anyway, and I’m tired of it. You can wash up
the glasses and dust up around the bar. In the
afternoon when you come home from school, you can be
around in case there’s any errands. At night you can
look after the pool table, collect for the games, and
see that they don’t steal the balls. You can serve the
drinks when there’s a card game, and bring a new
deck when some sore loser tears the old one up.”

I was so grateful to Cy that I gave him my very
best “thank you.” Here was a chance to get on in
life, to have my own money, and be independent and
mix around with men—to learn something of the
world. I was so taken with this notion that I hunted
up the broom, which was worn down to the strings,
and began sweeping out the barroom. There were no
customers in the place. Cy stood by, his hat on one
side of his head, a big cigar in the opposite side of his
mouth, hands in pockets, and eyed me thoughtfully.
When I had the place about half swept out, Cy came
over and took the broom out of my hands. He turned
it about, examined it carefully. “Johnnie, I think
you’re on the square with me, and I’m going to be on
the up and up with you. You go to the store and get
yourself a new broom.”

I did that, and swept the place all over again.
Having started to work without my father’s permission I
decided to say nothing till I got well settled in my job.
I had a feeling that he might veto the whole thing if
I told him at the start, but if I waited a while and had
a few dollars saved up he might let me continue.

Father knew Cy very well. On rare occasions he
went into the bar and had a drink and a talk with him.

I worked faithfully, early and late. At the end of
the week, in the afternoon when there was no customer
about, Cy mysteriously beckoned me into his “office,”
a small closet of a room at one end of the bar. It was
simply furnished—a table, a chair, a large spittoon,
one picture on the wall opposite the desk. A picture
of the mighty John L. Sullivan in fighting pose. Cy
seated himself at the table, put on a pair of glasses,
and drew out a small notebook. He looked carefully
about the room. Seeing the door of his office open, he
told me to close it.

To me Cy had always been much of a mystery. He
had been “out West”—to Leadville, Deadwood, and
San Francisco. He owned the latest pattern of
repeating rifle and a couple of “forty-fives.” He played
poker. I thought I was now to be initiated into some
of the secret activities of his life. Maybe he would
ask me to do something dangerous. Well, whatever,
it was, I would do it. He wrote something in the
notebook, then took three silver dollars out of his
pocket and put them in my hand, carefully, without
clinking them.

“Johnnie, this is pay day.”

I went back to work happy. Pay day, three dollars
of my own money. I would have a gray suit, gray hat,
gloves, and a leather trunk in no time. I would soon
be a tall, handsome, distinguished-looking gentleman,
on Cy’s money. I jingled my three dollars loudly and
could hardly wait for my father to come home so I
could tell him about my working and ask him to mind
my money for me.

The possession of three dollars changed me at once.
I became independent, confident, secure. When father
came in I went to him without a single misgiving,
feeling sure he would approve. I had my money in my
hand and my spirit was high. I told him I had been
working for Mr. Near all week; that I had three
dollars in wages and wanted him to take care of them
for me. He took the money and put it in his pocket,
saying: “All right. Let me know when you want it.”

“And you don’t mind my working for Cy?”

“No. I don’t mind. Cy told me all about it.
You will have to learn to work some time. And you
will have to learn lots of other things. So you may
as well start at Cy’s.”

He turned to his paper, and I thought the thing was
settled, but as I went out of the room I saw him
twisting up the end of his long beard.

The school work was no trouble to me. I put in a
year, and vacation time came along almost before I
knew it. I was saving all the money I earned as
assistant to Cy, and was looking forward to earning
more during vacation. I brought home to my father a
report from the school which seemed to show that
I had made good progress. He glanced at the card
and threw it to one side.

“I suppose you have the multiplication table this
time, John?”

“Oh, yes, I learned it at last.”

“How many are eight times nine, John?”

“Seventy-two, sir.”

“Good. Seven times six?”

“Forty-two, sir.”

“Correct, John.” 

He did not seem to be much interested in my correct
and prompt answers; kept on looking at his paper.
Finally he looked at me and said: “And eight times
thirteen, John?”

I was stuck again. This one froze me stiff. I got
mad, red in the face. I took pencil and paper out of
my pockets, figured it out, and give him the result. It
seemed that he was taking advantage of me. Nobody
at school had ever asked me that question. I felt
wronged. I thought of my money and my two big
horse pistols. If I was to be treated in this way I
would take my money and pistols and go away where
I could get a square deal. And if I did not get a
square deal, I’d take it.

Father looked at the paper I gave him. “Why, you
have it right, John. That’s good, very good.” He
was stroking his beard thoughtfully, and I could not
tell whether he was smiling or making a face.

Vacation was almost over. I needed new books for
the coming season and spoke to father about them one
night.

“Never mind them now. We will see about them
later. We are going away, going to Kansas City. I
have been promoted after all these years.”

“But I will lose my job,” I demurred.

“I’ll get you another job. Don’t worry. Do you
want a regular job, working all day, or would you
like to go to school some more?”

I decided to have an all-day job, and let the school
go.

“All right,” he said, “we’ll see about it.”

My father made no fuss about leaving the small
town where he had spent ten years of his life. He had
no close friends or cronies. After my mother died, he
seldom spoke to any one but me, and I think he was
glad to go away. He was a cold, hard, silent
Scotch-Irishman. He took no part in social doings, never
went to church, belonged to no clubs; nor was he
enough interested in politics to become a citizen and
exercise the high privilege of voting on election day.

My good-bys did not take much time. Cy was sorry
to have me go. He laboriously wrote me a fine letter
of recommendation which he gave me along with a
large, worn silver watch, that wound with a key. It
weighed almost a pound, and I was proportionately
proud of it. My boy friends envied me in going away
to a big city and impressed upon me the necessity for
taking my pistols with me. Unnecessary advice; I had
no intention of leaving them behind.

And last of all I hunted up old Beverly Shannon, the
bad man. He was a hooknosed old man with hard
eyes and a long chin whisker dripping tobacco juice.
He had worn the Northern blue, and drew a small
pension for a “bad leg.” Times when he was half
drunk, limping around town in search of more drinks,
some one would say: “Look out, ‘Bev.’ You’re limpin’
on the wrong leg.” This always brought a string of
eloquent curses from him, and a warning that they
had “better be keerful. I hain’t stopped killin’ jest
’cause Abe Lincoln says the war’s over.”

In those days all roads led to the harness shop, and
there “old Bev” was always to be found when
sober, outside the shop on a bench under a tree. There
he met all the droughty farmers and entertained them
with war stories and tales of his wanderings “out
West.” He was always invited to drink with them.
His pension kept him in food. His life held no serious
problem.

I found him on his bench, sober and sorry for it.
He passed the time of day with me, and I told him I
was going away and had come to say good-by.

“Goin’ to the city, huh? Well, don’t let ’em rub
it into you. You ain’t a very strong boy.” He was a
foxy old man. He leered at me out of his cunning
eyes. “Have you got any shootin’ irons?” Long
John Silver, the pirate, could not have done any better
in the way of complimenting a boy. I was fairly
hooked. I assured him that I was well heeled, having
two pistols.

“That’s good. You’ll git along all right. Now you
run along. I’ve got to git me a farmer. I ain’t had
my whisky yet.”

I hastily dug up enough silver out of my small
pocket money for a couple of drinks, and gave it to
him. As I went away I thought he looked like an old
spider watching his web for a fly.

## Chapter IV

In his new position father was forced to travel
much, often leaving me to my own devices for weeks
and sometimes months. I was put up at a small
boarding house kept by a widow, who had two children. She
was over-worked, sickly, and cranky. She had half a
dozen boarders. Before he left, father gave me the
money I had saved up, and told me to look about for
a job.

There was nobody at the hotel that interested me.
The widow was always whining and I kept away from
her. Her children were too small for company, and
I saw nothing of the other boarders except at
mealtimes when they ate much and talked little.

The widow gave me a trunkful of books she had
taken for a board bill. Among them I found a
battered old volume of Dumas’ “The Count of Monte
Cristo,” on which I put in many nights. This sharpened
my appetite for reading, and I went around secondhand
bookstores, and got hold of the D’Artagnan tales and
devoured them. Then “Les Misérables,” and on to
the master, Dickens. The books so fired me with the
desire for travel, adventure, romance, that I was
miserable most of the time. As my money dwindled I
resolved to find a job. I’d ask the landlady for advice.

I found her out in front, scrubbing the steps, red
in the face and vicious looking. I told her I was
thinking of going to work.

“Well, it’s about time you thought of that,” she
snapped, “layin’ around here readin’ and eatin’ up your
father’s money. You can get a job just like I did when
my husband run off and left me with two brats on my
hands. I just started out and asked for it at every
place I come to till I got it, that’s all. And you can
do it, too, if you got the gizzard.”

I left her and started my search. If there was a
job in the city I determined to get it. I went through
block after block, store after store, hour after hour.
I got mostly “Noes” but some answered pleasantly,
taking my name and address. I kept going until one
morning I stopped in front of a cigar store—a
dead-looking place, no customers. A man was reading a
paper spread out on the counter. I went in and put my
question to him. When he stood up I saw he was
very tall and very thin. He looked sick. I had never
seen an eye like his. It attracted me strangely. I
could not have described it then, but I can now. It
was a larcenous eye. He was very nice, asking many
questions. How old was I? Did I ever work before?
Where? I handed him Cy’s letter. He read it and
asked me more questions. I have never answered so
many questions since, except in a police station. At
last he quit, and snapping himself together like a man
coming out of a trance, he rapped his knuckles on the
counter.

“I’ll tell you what I’ll do with you, kid. You come
down here at nine o’clock every morning, open this
joint up, and stay here till one o’clock. Then I come
on and you go off till six in the evening. At six you
come on and stay till ten, and call it a day. You can
go to work right now. The sooner the better. In a
week you will know the prices of the different things
as well as I do, and I can leave you by yourself. Your
wages will be three dollars a week and all the cigars
you can smoke.”

“But I do not smoke.”

“Well, that’s your bad luck, kid, not mine. What
do you say? Want to chance the job?”

I got right in behind the counter and he showed
me the different cigars, cigarettes, and tobaccos, and
told me their prices. In a week I knew all about the
“store” and had learned to serve the few customers
that came in, and to make change properly. I further
learned that the store was but a “front” or blind for a
poker game and dice games in the back room, and that
I was a part of the “front.” My business was to sweep
the place out in the morning, stand behind the counter
in case any one wanted a cigar, and to keep an eye out
for “new coppers on the beat” in the evening. The
job was interesting. I soon came to know the poker
players, crap shooters, and dice sharks who brought
their victims into the back room to “clean” them. I
often spent my afternoons in the back room watching
the games and learning the life.

When there was no game, the sharks sat around
practicing their tricks and bewailing their bad luck.
Sometimes a poker player would show me how to
“shuffle up a hand,” or cut the cards at a given place
or “go out” with a hand. The dice shakers and crap
shooters showed me their favorite “shots.” I was an
apt scholar, absorbing everything like a young sponge.
“Tex,” my boss (if he had any other name I never
heard it), admonished me never to gamble. “Lay
away from it, kid; it’s a tough racket. Look at me
and my gatherings of forty years. I ain’t got a white
quarter to my name; if it was rainin’ soup I couldn’t
buy myself a tin spoon, and I’ve got a string of debts
longer than a widow’s clothesline.”

Next door to the cigar store there was a small milk
depot kept by a man and his wife. I used to go in
every day for a glass of milk, and got acquainted with
them. He delivered milk around his routes and the
wife minded the shop. He was forever complaining
about not being able to collect his money from “them
women.” “Them women” were women who kept
“parlor houses” in the Tenderloin district a few blocks
from his milk store. They were good pay, but he
could not get away from his work at the right hour to
find them.

One day he told me he would pay me well if I would
take the bills and go to the places and stay till I got
the money. Here was a chance to earn more money,
and I grabbed it. I went in and asked Tex, my boss,
when would be the best time to call at those places to
collect the milk bills.

If Tex had not gathered much of worldly goods in
his forty years, he had at least learned something of
the habits of “them women.” “I’ll tell you,” he said.
“If you go in the morning you’ll find them asleep; in
the afternoon they are out riding or shopping; and
at night they will be either too busy or too drunk.
Take my advice and go about five o’clock in the
evening and you will catch them at dinner, or breakfast, or
whatever they call it.”

I followed Tex’s advice that evening and collected
three bills out of five. The milkman was pleased with
my enterprise and gave me a dollar. Thereafter I
collected his bills in the Tenderloin. I visited certain
places weekly and was paid promptly. The women I
met were nice to me, and I saw nothing of the other
side of their lives. I worked faithfully at my two
jobs, saved my money, and began looking in the store
windows for my gray suit and gray hat. My work
kept me so busy that I did not read much. Thoughts
of travel and adventure were in the back of my mind,
but that could wait. I was young; I must have money
first. My two old, rusty pistols, almost forgotten now,
lay neglected in the bottom of my little valise.

Tex had a “run of luck” and raised me to four
dollars a week. I collected more bills for the milkman.
Some of them he called “bad bills.” I kept after them
persistently and nearly always got the money. The
more hopeless the bill, the greater my commission was.
I enjoyed going after them. The Tenderloin women
were sure pay; and poor families were good, always
had the money ready. I called on a tough saloon man,
in a dingy little dive, about ten times to collect a
two-dollar bill.

One day when I called he was serving several men
at his bar, and when he saw me he said: “No use
comin’ in here with that bill, kid. I ain’t goin’ to pay
it. If your boss comes up here I’ll bust him in the
nose. His milk is no good and he’s no good.”

“Mister,” I said, “I know he is no good, but I have
to work and want to keep my job. If you knew just
how hard my boss is you would feel sorry for me
instead of being angry. He is so hard and no good that
he told me if I did not collect your bill of two dollars
to-day I need not come to work to-morrow, and that’s
why I’m here.”

The customers looked at me. I stood my ground.

“Hell,” said the man, “I didn’t think he was that
bad. Here, take the lousy money.” 

I hurried back to the milkman. “Here’s Mr.
Finucane’s two dollars.”

“How on earth did you ever collect it?”

“Oh, he just got tired and paid me, that’s all.”

“Well, I’ll make you a present of them,” said he
handing me the money. “You certainly earned them.”

The following week I called at Madam Kate
Singleton’s with my bill. The colored maid who opened the
door showed me a seat in the hall and told me to wait.
The madam was dressing. I sat there a few minutes
and there was a ring at the door. The maid opened
it and an excited little man brushed in, followed by
two big men who were not a bit excited. As the door
was closing I got a glimpse of a policeman in uniform
on the steps.

One of the two men spoke to the maid who went
upstairs, and in a minute the madam came down. She
waved the men into a room off the hall and closed the
door. I listened, but they talked too low for me to
hear what they were saying. Presently the madam
opened the door and called out: “Oh, girls, come
downstairs every one of you.” Half a dozen girls
appeared as if by magic. They were all brought into
the room and the door closed again.

Nobody paid any attention to me. Now I heard
loud voices in the room, but so many were talking at
once that I could make nothing of it. Then one of
the big men came out, went to the front door, opened
it, and said to the policeman: “Send Mike around to
the back; tell him to let nobody out. I’ll phone for
the wagon. We’ll have to take them all to the station.
They won’t talk.”

He disappeared into the room. I got up and opened
the front door.

“Where are you goin’?” said the policeman.

“I’m going out, if you please.”

“Get back in there, if you please,” he snarled, “and 
stay there.”

While the officers were waiting for the wagon one
of the big men went upstairs and brought down two
“guests.” They were about half awake and looked
as if they had been on a drunk. They sat down beside
me on the settee. One of them fell into a sound sleep
and the other sat with his elbows on his knees and
his hands on the sides of his head. Neither of them
spoke. In a few minutes the wagon arrived. The
girls were all ordered to go out and get in it, which
they did. Then the two men and I were ordered to do
the same. The madam and one of the big men got
into a hack that appeared to be waiting and drove
away.

The excited little man who had caused all the
trouble got into the wagon with the other big man and
sat beside him.

When I was being put in the wagon I protested and
tried to explain, but the detectives roughly ordered me
to shut up. The “harness cop” who had been at the
front door went back to his beat. I did not see
anything of Mike, who had been ordered to stay at the
back door.

The girls laughed and joked on the way to the
station and shouted “rubberneck” at everybody that
looked in at the back of the open wagon. The police
station was on one corner of Market Square, one of
the busiest corners in the city. Hundreds of people
were there daily, selling their produce. Their time was
about evenly divided between serving their customers
and watching the patrol wagon spewing its loads of
humanity into the city prison. It seemed to me they
were all there as we were unloaded and hurried
through a solid lane of them into the police station.
Madam Singleton was there before us, and with her
was a tall, sharp-looking man, gray and about fifty.
I never found out who he was, but he looked like a
lawyer.

The madam, the tall man, and the two big men,
who were plain-clothes detectives, went to one side,
talking earnestly for a minute or two. The rest of us
just stood there and waited. One of the detectives
went into an office off the big room we were in, and
came out at once with a man in uniform he called
“captain.” The captain was a big, red-faced,
gray-haired, good-natured Irishman. “Well, what’s this all
about?” he said, smiling. The detective stepped over
to the small, nervous man and said to the captain:

“Captain, this man complains that one of the girls
in Kate Singleton’s place took one hundred dollars,
two fifty-dollar bills, from him some time last night or
this morning. We went down to her place and saw
the girl. She denies that she took it.

“We searched her room and couldn’t find it. The
balance of them don’t know anything, so they say. He
wants them all searched. We couldn’t do it there, so
we pinched everybody in the house and here they are,
ten of ’em, seven women and three men.”

The captain took the little man in hand. “Who
are you?” The little man hesitated.

“Come on, out with it. If you want any help here
you’ve got to come clean.”

The little man gave him a name. I could not hear
it.

“Where are you from?”

“Emporia, Kansas, is my town.”

“What do you do for a living?”

“I’m a hog raiser.”

“When did you come to the city?”

“Yesterday morning.”

“What did you come here for?”

“Oh, just to look around.”

The captain smiled. “How much money did you
have when you got off the train here yesterday
morning?”

“I had two hundred dollars in paper money and
some small change.”

“How much have you spent since you arrived here?”

“I spent twenty-five dollars for a suit of clothes
and fifteen dollars for an overcoat. I paid a dollar
for a room and I spent about five dollars around
town.”

“Is that all? Are you sure, now? Think again.”

“Yes, that’s all,” said the hog man.

“You’re a liar,” Madam Singleton said in a cold,
level voice. “You gave Julia ten dollars.”

“Now, now, Kate,” said the captain, “don’t get
excited. I’ll take care of this thing all right.” Then
to the hog man:

“Guess you forgot about that ten dollars, hey?”

“Yes, I forgot that,” he said meekly.

“All right; now, how much have you in your
pockets?”

He took out some bills and counted them.
“Forty-five dollars is all I have.”

The captain counted them and returned them.
“That’s correct. Now, which girl took your money?”

The man pointed out the youngest girl of the bunch.
She was about twenty or twenty-two, a plump girl with
a boyish face and lots of black hair. She was pleasant
looking, but not pretty, and she did not look as worn
and tired as the others.

She looked straight at him but never opened her
mouth. The lawyer-looking man said to her: “Julia,
did you take that man’s money?”

“No,” she answered.

“Take all these women in and have the matron
search them. Madam Singleton, you have no
objection to being searched, have you?” smiled the captain.

“None at all, captain, only make it short and sweet.
I am losing time and money here.”

They all trooped off to a room down the hall.

An officer came out from behind the desk and
searched me and the two drunks. We had no
fifty-dollar bills, so he told us to sit on a bench in front of
his desk. The lawyer, or bondsman, or fixer, or
whatever he was, paced up and down the room nervously.
The captain had gone back to his office.

In a few minutes a big, mannish-looking woman with
red hands and a tough walk came along.

“Well, what did you find?” said the lawyer.

“Nothing. They didn’t have a hundred dollars
among them.”

The lawyer then hunted up the detective and the
hog man. The detective got the captain. The matron
made her report and the officer who searched me and
the other two did the same.

The captain turned to the hog man.

“All these people have been searched and your
money has not been found. What do you want to do
now?”

“I want that girl locked up. I know she got my
money. I know I had two fifty-dollar bills rolled up
with my other bills when I went into that house, and
when I got to my room I looked at my money and
they were gone.”

“How long was it before you got to your room
after you left Madam Singleton’s?” asked the
lawyer.

“Oh, I walked around for an hour or two.”

“Oh, you did, eh? Why, you probably had your
pocket picked on the street.”

The big captain roared out a laugh and said to the
lawyer:

“It must have been an Emporia, Kansas, pickpocket.
No Missouri dip would take his roll, extract two
fifty-dollar bills, and put the rest back in his pocket.”

The lawyer appeared to get angry. “You’ve
searched everybody but me.”

He turned to the hog man fiercely. “Do you want
me searched?”

“No, I don’t.”

“Well, I want you searched. You are just the kind
of a yap that gets up in the middle of the night and
hides his money so carefully that he has to have a
policeman find it for him in the morning. Go ahead
and search him,” he said to the detective.

“All right, go ahead,” said the hog man.

The detective went through his trousers carefully,
placing everything on a counter, then through his vest,
then into his inner coat pocket. No money. Then, as
an afterthought, just to make a good job of it, he felt
in the coat pockets. In the first one was a bag of
tobacco, and as he pulled a handkerchief from the last
coat pocket two bills fluttered to the floor.

The lawyer stooped, picked up the two bills, looked
at them, and handed them to the captain. The hog
man’s eyes bulged till they looked ready to fall out
of his head. He was making a dry noise down in his
throat that sounded like the quack of a duck. The
captain handed him the bills.

“Is this your money?” he scowled.

After inspecting the bills and recovering his voice,
the hog man said: “Yes, I think it is.”

The lawyer plucked him by the lapel with one hand,
and shook the other in his face. “You dirty little
swine, get your property off that counter. Get out of
here and back to your hog pastures before I have you
locked up.”

The dazed and thoroughly crushed victim hastily
gathered up his things and went out with them in his
hands.

I was pop-eyed with amazement at this swift,
smashing reversal of the situation. The two drunks beside
me were but mildly interested. Nobody, from the
captain down to Julia, the accused, seemed surprised.

I could not understand why the whole crowd did not
fall on the hog man and tear him to pieces. The
captain disappeared into his office. The detective walked
out to the sidewalk. The lawyer turned to Kate and
the girls, bowing:

“Madam, and ladies, shall we depart?”

“It’s about time,” said the madam in a positive
voice. “I’m hungry enough to eat a raw dog.”

They all moved out into the street. I was left on the
bench with the two drunks. The detective strolled
back in. The desk man pointed to us.

“What will I do with this outfit, Hayes?”

Hayes appeared to be disgusted. “Oh, charge them
with drunk.”

“The kid’s not drunk.”

“Vag him then.”

“What were you doing in that joint, anyway?” to
me.

“I went in there to collect a milk bill, sir, and was
waiting for the money when all this happened.”

“Where is the bill?”

I produced it.

“Do you work for this man?” he asked, after
inspecting it.

“Yes, sir.”

“Why in hell didn’t you say so at the start?”

“I tried to, sir, but everybody told me to shut up.
The policeman would not let me go out.”

He turned to the drunks and asked them if they
had ten dollars to put up for bail to appear in the
morning. They had, and the desk man took them
into another room. I saw them no more. When he
came back, Hayes said:

“Take the kid upstairs: lock him up with George.
I’ll find out about him.”

The women were gone, the drunks were out, and I
was the only one detained. It looked all wrong to me.
The sergeant took me down to the end of the hall
and opened an iron door. It was as if he had opened
the door to hell. My blood stopped circulating. We
stepped inside and he locked the door behind us.
Never since, except perhaps in the half dreams of
opium, have I been so frozen with horror. We were
standing on a balcony overlooking the half basement
that served as the city prison. In front of us was a
latticework iron door that opened on an iron stairway
leading down into the cell house. The cells were built
around the four sides of a cement-floored square, and
opened into it. It was supper time and pandemonium
was on.

The sergeant rapped on the iron door with his
heavy keys, trying to attract the attention of some one
below. Failing to make himself heard, he told me to
stay there till he could get a “trusty” to take me
upstairs. He went out the way we came in, and left
me locked in between the two doors on the balcony.
The cells below had all been thrown open and there
were about fifty prisoners in the open space. They
seemed to be about equally divided between negroes
and whites, of all ages. The air choked me; it was
putrid, heavy, and thick with the stench of foul food,
foul clothes, foul bodies, and foul sewers. In the
farthest corner of the square a gigantic black was
standing guard over a huge smoking caldron.

He was shirtless and barefoot. A leather belt
supported his overalls, his only clothing. Sweat glinted
on his broad back and chest. He was armed with a
long-handled ladle which he dished out the “stew”
with, or beat back the stronger and more venturesome
prisoners who crowded too closely around the caldron.

I saw no jailers or guards. There was no pretense
at order. The younger and stronger men shoved and
elbowed their way to the big stew pot, snarling and
snapping at each other like a pack of starved dogs.
Old men and young boys stood around waiting meekly
for the strong to be fed first.

The big negro wielded his ladle, filling the tin pans
nearest him. Bread was being served from a large
box in another spot, but there appeared to be plenty
of it and there was no scramble there. Several
new-looking prisoners walked about, making no effort to get
food. They were “fresh fish,” new arrivals, who had
not yet acquired the “chuck horrors,” that awful
animal craving for food that comes after missing half
a dozen meals.

At last the weaker ones were served. The cursing,
shouting, and fighting were stilled. The big negro
wheeled his stew pot away and the empty bread box
disappeared. Some of the prisoners went into their
cells to eat; some sat down outside on the floor, while
others ate standing. Some had spoons, others ate
with their fingers, sopping at the bottom of the pan
with a piece of bread.

The meal was quickly over. The tin pans,
unwashed, were thrown into the cells. The young
negroes began singing and buck dancing. White men
who had been tearing at each other ten minutes before
around the big pot were now laughing and talking in
a friendly fashion, and everybody lit up a smoke. The
air was so filled with tobacco smoke and steam
from the stew that I could barely distinguish forms
below.

It was growing dark and gas jets were lighted but
gave no light. I heard a rattling of keys; somewhere
some one shouted “Inside.” The shadowy forms
shuffled into their cells, and there came the tremendous
din of iron doors being slammed shut. The prison was
locked up for the night.

I do not know how long I had been standing there.
Not more than fifteen minutes, but it seemed a
lifetime. A trusty prisoner appeared at my side.

“Come on, you.”

I followed him up a short stairway where he opened
a door and we went into a short hall with cells on
either side. It was directly above the city prison.
As we passed down the hall I heard women’s voices;
one of them shouted, “Fresh fish, girls.”

Faces appeared at the barred doors. A colored girl,
as we passed her cell, said: “Hello, boy, what you-all
been doin’?”

At the end of the hall the trusty stopped at a large
room with a barred door. I could look inside. The
room was well lighted. Newspapers were lying about.
I saw two clean-looking cots, a table on which were
books and a box of cigars, and a couple of chairs.

A man was pacing up and down the room, smoking.
He wore a comfortable-looking pair of slippers and
was in his shirt sleeves. He paid no attention to us till
the trusty said: “George, the skipper sent up some
company for you.”

He turned sharply and came to the door. He was
a fine-looking man about forty years of age, well
groomed, fresh shaven. He was tall. His hair was
gray. His face was pleasant to look at. He might
have been a doctor or lawyer. I found myself
wondering what he could have done to get locked in a jail.
He looked at me carefully for a minute. When he
spoke his voice was surprisingly pleasant. There was
a suggestion of the South in his drawl.

“I don’t want to hurt your feelings, kid, but if you
are lousy don’t come in here, that’s all.”

The trusty assured George that I was not lousy,
that there was no charge against me and I would
be out in an hour or two.

I was locked in.

I had no jail manners then, so I just stood at the
door with my hat on, intending to wait there till some
one came to let me go. All prisoners do that the first
time. Presently my companion told me to take my hat
off and sit down, and try to be comfortable.

“You may get out in an hour and you may not. You
never can tell. You are beginning young. How old
are you?”

“Sixteen.”

“What are you pinched for?”

I told him all about it.

“That’s everyday business here,” he said. “Usually
the sucker is a married man and can’t squawk. But
when he does squawk, like this one, the only thing to
do is to blow back his money. Either the lawyer or
one of the girls eased it into his coat pocket. That’s
better than returning it to him and admitting that they
tried to rob him.

“The whole thing was a stand-in from the captain
down. Everybody’s satisfied. The sucker has his
money, the girls are all out, Kate will charge Julia
fifty dollars for the lawyer’s fee, and that ends it.

“You appear to be the only real sucker in the bunch.
By God! Those coppers are fierce. They’ll leave you
here till you rot. I’ve always said a copper is a copper
till you cut his head off.”

He got a tin cup and scraped it across the bars of
the door. The trusty bounced in. “Go down and get
the desk sergeant.”

I never saw a prisoner get quicker action. The
sergeant came at once.

“It’s a rotten shame to keep this kid locked up, Sam.
Did you hear his story? Go down and get Hayes and
tell him to let him go home. Send a messenger to his
boss. I’ve got plenty of money down there; charge
it to me.”

The sergeant went out, promising to “look into it
right away.” Our cell—it was more like a room—was
in a small corridor set apart for the women prisoners’
quarters. Down the hall I could hear them calling to
each other and chatting back and forth from their cells.
Somewhere a colored woman was singing a mournful
dirge about “That Bad Stackalee.” The verses were
endless. The point of the song seemed to be that the
negro bully, Stackalee, had been killed with “a big
forty-four gun over a damned old Stetson hat.” In the
most harrowing tones at the end of every verse the
singer moaned the sad refrain, “That ba-a-d
Stackalee.”

Later I came to know that this song is a favorite
among negroes when in great trouble, such as being
locked in jail, being double-crossed by a friend, or
parting with their money in a dice game. At such times
thirty or forty verses of “Stackalee” invariably restores
the laughing good humor and child-like confidence of
the wronged one.

We heard a rattling of keys and a door opening.
George put the side of his face against the cell door,
so he could see down the hall.

“Get your hat, kid; here they are.”

The detective came up with my two bosses—the
milkman and Tex, the gambler. The trusty opened
the door.

“Out you go,” said the detective, “and the next time
you get jammed up say something before you get
thrown in. Holler before you’re hurt; that’s my
motto.”

I said good-by to my benefactor, George, and
thanked him awkwardly. When I met him years
after and had a chance to return his kindness, I learned
he was a most distinguished criminal; a man who had
stolen fortunes and spent them, who had killed a
crooked pal, and served many prison sentences.

“Forget it, kid, and don’t let them scare you out of
your job. You go right back next week and collect
your bills.”

Tex and the milkman escorted me to the cigar store.
The evening games had not started when we went into
the back room, so I told my story again. The milkman
sympathized and promised to raise my commission on
the bills. Tex was relieved to learn that I had not
mentioned his “store” to the police.

Collection day came around again, and I made my
rounds without incident till I got to Madam
Singleton’s, the last place. A colored maid, the only person
that escaped arrest the week before, opened the door.

When she saw me she screamed at the top of her
voice:

“Oh, Miss Kate, here’s the pore milk boy.”

“Bring him right up here, Jo, this minute.”

The maid led me upstairs, then down a hall and to
the madam’s room. She was in the midst of dressing
for the evening, but when I appeared in the door she
stopped, kicked a bunch of clothes to one side, came
over and, putting her arm around me, led me into the
room.

“Well, you poor boy,” she patted my back. “We
are ashamed to face you after going off and forgetting
you in jail. Julia thought of you about nine o’clock
that night, and I sent down word right away about you.
They said you were out and gone home. We never
expected to see you again. You must have dinner with
us. It’s ready now, and Julia wants to apologize to
you. Not that it was her fault,” she added quickly.
“It was just something that couldn’t be helped. Those
men from the country are always—ah—misplacing
their money. We are continually having trouble with
them.”

She was so charming and friendly and natural, so
different from the crabby widow at my boarding house,
the only woman I had any contact with, that I found
myself wondering if George had not been too severe
in judging them.

She went on with her dressing, and I looked about
the room curiously. I had a dim recollection of my
mother’s room—a plain bed, a bureau, a big
rocking-chair, and a rag carpet. I had looked into the widow’s
room at the boarding house, too. That was plainer
than my mother’s. It had a cheap, single bed; a
packing case covered with a sheet, and a cracked mirror
propped against the wall served as a bureau. There
was a hard-looking chair at the head of the bed. There
was no carpet on the widow’s floor.

Madam Singleton’s room had carpets an inch thick,
and the biggest, softest bed and the fattest pillows
you could imagine. Her bureau was half as large as
the bed, but seemed too small for the things piled on
it—boxes, bottles, brushes, combs, pieces of jewelry,
and a hundred other articles I had never seen and
could not guess the use of. Mirrors were everywhere;
from where I sat I could see my face, my profile, or my
back. A huge trunk, as big as a bungalow it looked,
was in a corner. Its top was thrown back and the tray
was on the floor. It was piled high with letters and
cards and photos of men. The trunk was overflowing
with stockings, garters, ribbons, feathers, and soft,
silky-looking garments. My eyes strayed into the
open door of a closet. It was full of coats and cloaks,
long and short, some of fur of different colors, and
others of expensive cloth. Wide rimmed and
feathered hats hung everywhere, and the carpet was half
covered with shoes, slippers, sandals, gloves, and silk
dresses. Over everything hung the odor of perfume.
Years after I heard Madam Singleton described as a
very beautiful woman. When she turned from her
mirror, I thought she looked as a queen ought to
look.

Tall, straight, dark-haired with big, brave black
eyes; warm, full of color, glowing; a dominating
woman.

I heard a small bell tinkling downstairs.

“That means dinner, young man. Come with me.”

## Chapter V

“Give me a name, any name you like,” said the
madam as we went downstairs. “I want you to meet
my girls. They’ll all be glad to see you again.”

I had but one name then, so I gave her that, and
was introduced to the girls who were waiting in the
dining room, the same six girls that had been arrested.
If they noticed my embarrassment they did not show it.
Two or three of them nodded, looked at me half
curiously, half amused; the others, excepting Julia,
did not even glance at me. She came over to
where I stood, put her arms about my neck, and
kissed me.

“Oh, you poor kid, I never felt so sorry for
anything in my life.”

I was seated between the madam and Julia. The
dinner was a marvel—fried chicken, hot biscuits, green
vegetables. Beer was served, but I did not like it and
the maid got me milk. The madam and Julia were
the only ones that ate heartily. The others picked
at their food, yawned, and looked at each other with
low-lidded, feline calculating glances, seldom speaking.
They looked and acted tired, worn, old, frustrated,
disappointed. A big dark woman opposite me got a
bottle from the sideboard and poured herself a drink
of something.

“Now, my dear, be careful,” said the madam.

“Why didn’t you say that a year ago, Miss Kate?”

She took a piece of chicken in her fingers and went
into a room across the hall where she played “Annie
Rooney” on the piano and sang with her mouth full
of food. Two others got up and went out. A blond
girl pushed her chair back, lighted a cigarette,
and began doing her fingernails. The maid came and
whispered to another, who jumped up quickly and
disappeared.

Julia had finished the chicken and was crunching
the bones between her strong white teeth. The last
of the tired-looking girls stood up, put her foot on a
chair, and ran her arm, elbow deep, into her stocking.
She came up with a small roll of bills which she threw
across the table to the madam, sullenly. “Thank the
Lord that’s over,” she said, and went out.

The madam counted the money carefully, bent
over, and put both her arms under the table; when she
straightened up the money had disappeared.

Julia chattered away and ate everything in sight.
She wanted to know if I had ever lived in the country,
if I could ride a horse, if I had ever caught a fish, if
I could “shoot off a revolver.”

The dinner was over and I was thinking about my
milk bill. After this wonderful hour I hesitated about
presenting it to the madam. She may have seen what
was in my mind, for she said, “Julia, you have talked
so much to this boy that he has forgotten what he
came here for.”

“I’m not done talking yet, Miss Kate. You know
Sunday is my day out, and I’ve made up my mind to
have a horseback ride in the country. I’ve been
wanting to do that ever since I came here and here is my
chance. The kid here can ride, and I’ll take him with
me. If you’ll go,” turning to me.

I hesitated.

“Oh, come on. I’ll pay for the horses and
everything, and see that you get back before dark,” she
laughed.

“All right, I’ll go,” I said.

Julia looked at the madam. “Oh, I have no
objection, Julia. You’ll be out of mischief for one day and
you’re just a couple of kids, anyway.”

She took my bill, gave me the money and went out.

Julia was hopping around like a sparrow. “Let’s
see,” she said. “You be here Sunday morning at, oh,
ten o’clock. No, not here, that’s no good. Be at
the drug store down on the corner at ten. I’ll meet
you there.”

I promised to be there and departed. On my way
home I passed the police station and pictured in my
mind the inferno inside—the big negro swinging his
ladle above the snarling, cursing horde of half-starved
prisoners in the stinking bowels of the city prison.

At Madam Singleton’s my boyish mind had not
grasped the greater tragedy. Fresh air, light, meat,
drink, and music—that was all I saw there then.
But the tired women were prisoners more
hopeless than the savage men fighting for food in the jail.
The bodily comforts they had at Madam Singleton’s
but served to tighten their shackles. Life-timers of
society, they were slowly sinking without a straw to
grasp at.

The time flew till Sunday. I looked over my clothes
and wished I had my gray suit and gray hat. I had
saved my money but had not enough yet to buy them.

I was apprehensive about meeting Julia. I could
picture her coming into the drug store for me in a
dashing big hat, rustling silk dress, expensive shoes,
all powdered, perfumed, and painted as she was in
Madam Singleton’s. And me with my pants too short,
my coat sleeves way up my wrists, and my shirt open
at the collar. I wanted to go, but at times my heart
failed me, and when I went to bed the Saturday night
before I was still undecided, hesitating.

Sunday morning I got up early, determined to face
the thing. I also settled another matter that had
disturbed my mind of late. I got a shave. I walked
around till I found an idle barber in his empty shop.
He fixed me up with as much ceremony as if I had
been an old customer.

At ten I was at the drug store, and Julia was inside,
waiting. I had to look twice to be sure of her. She
wore a faded blue tailored suit, a wide-rimmed straw
sailor hat with a ribbon, and a pair of worn but
substantial shoes. No powder or paint, nothing to
remind me of Madam Singleton’s.

“Don’t pay any attention to my clothes.” She saw
me looking at them. “These are the ones I had on
when I went there. I have lots of others, but. Miss
Kate won’t let me wear them when I go out unless I
am with her. I owe her so much money she is afraid
I’ll run away. All the girls owe her. They are always
in debt to her; that’s the way she keeps them there.”

We hunted up a livery stable near by. A big,
good-natured fat man was in charge, and we told him we
wanted some gentle saddle horses. He looked at
Julia. She had a cocky air, and acted more like a
boy than a girl.

“Do you want to ride straddle-legged, gal? If you
do, I’ve got some of them bloomer things.”

Julia did not blush or stammer. “No, I don’t want
to ride straddle. What do you think I am anyway?”
She was angry. “You get me a riding habit and a
side saddle and mind your own business.”

He went after the horses.

“We’ll go down to the river, get the ferry, and go
over into the woods. I hope we find some place to
eat over there. I am hungry already,” she said.

I had been too occupied to think of breakfast and
was hungry, too, and suggested that we go across the
street and get a bite. When we came back the horses
were ready. The fat man boosted Julia up into her
saddle, and we dashed off like Indians. Our way to
the river led past Miss Kate’s. When we were in
front of it Julia pulled up her horse, and we stopped.

“They are all dead to the world in there except
Jo, the colored girl. They won’t get up till four this
afternoon. God, what a place! How I hate to go
back there!”

The treacherous April showers came on us when
we got into the country and drove us into a deserted
cabin on an abandoned weed-grown farm. I built a
fire in the old fireplace. We found a couple of
homemade three-legged stools in a corner and in a box nailed
to the wall there was the greasiest pack of cards I
ever saw. We got a board that we put on the stools,
making a table, and played casino. The roof leaked
in a hundred places, the cabin was full of smoke, the
rain beat in from all sides, and Julia won every game.
She chattered away through it all, and hoped there
would be “a regular cyclone.” Discouraged, I threw
the cards in the fire. We were half wet and
watery-eyed from the smoke, the horses pawed restlessly in
the leaky shed behind the cabin. Julia laughed at me
and accused me of being a bad loser. I couldn’t think
of anything else, so I said: “Oh, I’m half starved,
and there’s nothing to eat within miles of here.”

She was just a healthy young animal, always hungry
like myself, and the thought of food, especially when
it was so far away, started her to raving. Nothing
would do but we must head for home. The
afternoon was half gone, the rain let up, and the sun shone
again. I stamped and beat out the fire.

Julia climbed upon a tree stump in front of the
cabin, where she got into her riding habit. I brought
her horse around and she leaped to the saddle like
an acrobat. The horses, homeward bound, needed no
urging. We let them go as fast as they liked, and in
the evening pulled up safely in front of the livery
stable, where Julia insisted on paying the bill. The
fat man reached for the money I proffered, but she
snatched it out of my hand and made him take hers.

“This is on me,” she said, returning my money,
“and so is the dinner. Come on, let’s find a good place
to eat.”

The fat man looked at me slyly, started to say
something, but changed his mind. He was afraid of
Julia.

Any place is a good place to eat when one is young
and hungry, and not burdened with money. We wasted
no time looking, but went into the first restaurant we
came to. Neither did we haggle over the menu card.
Julia found chicken, and there we stopped. She never
seemed to get enough of it. The dinner was a long
time coming; she popped her head out of the box every
minute looking for the busy waiter.

“I wonder what’s happened to him. He has either
dropped dead or the police came and arrested him,”
she was saying when he appeared. We fell on the
dinner and devoured it like a couple of hired men.
She had the waiter bring a cigar. I managed it fairly
well.

Her chatter ceased. She sat quietly, elbows on the
table, her face covered with her hands, strong-looking,
large, capable hands, but white and shapely. I
smoked and wondered about her. What a partner
she would make for me if she were not a girl! She
pushed her chair back, rested her hands in her lap,
and looked up at her bedraggled straw hat on a hook.
I thought she was ready to go, and got up to get it.

“Don’t touch it, I despise it,” she burst out. “I hate
these shoes.” She put her foot up. “And this dress
and every stitch of clothes on my back. Do you know
why? Because every one of them means a different
man. Do you want me to tell you about it; what a
tough time I’ve had? But you wouldn’t understand
it. You’re only a kid, like I was a couple of years
ago.”

“Tell me, anyway, Julia.”


Her story, new to me then, was as old as man’s
duplicity and woman’s inherent desire to be loved
and protected. Betrayed and deserted, fearing to face
her family, she stole enough of her father’s money
to take her to the city and into a hospital where her
baby was born. “And,” she continued, “I was glad
when it died, it was a girl, When I was well enough
to leave the hospital they couldn’t find my clothes.
Cheap as they were, somebody had taken them. A
man can go out into the street without a hat and coat,
kid, but just let a woman try it, even if she has the
nerve, and watch what happens to her. I had no
money. The doctor gave me this dress; that is, he
sold it to me and I paid for it the first time he got
drunk. One of the internes traded me these shoes.
He was just a dirty little beast and didn’t wait to get
drunk. Then the hospital cook got me that hat and
some cheap stockings and underclothes. He happened
to be a white man,” she said bitterly. “I suppose I
would have taken them just the same if he had been
a negro or a Chinaman. After the drunken doctor
I thought of nothing but suicide, anyway. But I had
to have enough clothes to get through the street and
down to the bridge where I could jump into the
river.

“The cook told me he would get me a job in a
restaurant downtown and that stopped me from going
to the river. He gave me money for a couple of
night’s lodging, and something to eat, and told me
where to go for a room. He came that night to my
room. When he left in the morning his last words
were: ‘I’ll go right out now and get you the job.’

“I waited all day but he never came back. He was
a liar; I never saw him again. When the third night
came my money was gone. I was starving, and the
rent was due. I wanted to go down to the river then,
but was so hungry I couldn’t bring myself to do it.”

She had talked furiously, with a storm of bitter
words. Now she stopped and smiled. “Yes, this
appetite of mine saved my life. I’ll never die hungry
if I can help it.

“Anyway,” she resumed, “this is the long and the
short of it. About nine o’clock that night the woman
of the place came up and wanted the rent. I told her
I was broke, and asked her to stand me off for a few
days till I could get a job or give me something to do
so I could earn the rent.

“What do you think she did, kid—the big,
man-eater! She took me by the arm, dragged me out into
the hall and pushed me downstairs. She went back and
got my hat, that straw hat hanging up there, and threw
it out on the sidewalk after me.

“A policeman was standing there and saw her do it.
He came up and asked me what the trouble was about.
Here is where I may get help, I thought, so I told him
I had just left the hospital, that my money was all
spent, and that I had been put out of my room. He
asked how old I was. I told him I was eighteen—
that’s two years ago, I’m twenty now. He asked if
I lived here in the city. I told him I lived in the
country, but was going to stay in the city and work.
He wrote something on a card and gave it to me,
saying: ‘I’ll get a hack driver to take you to a hotel. When
you get there give that card to the landlady.’

“The driver took me a few blocks to a place where
he stopped, let me out, and helped me up the steps.
He rang the bell and went away. I gave the card to
a colored girl who opened the door. She came back
in a minute and asked me to come in—and,” she
finished wearily, “I’ve been in Miss Kate’s ever since,
kid.

“Miss Kate took me in and dressed me up. She
charged me double for my clothes. I pay her, she
pays the milliner. It’s the same with all her girls.
No girl ever goes into her place unless she is broke
and ragged and sick and hungry. I’ve been there two
years, and if I stay there twenty years I will still be in
debt to her. The longer I stay the more I owe.
Everybody charges us double for what we buy. We have
to go to a certain drug store where we get robbed.
On our days off, Miss Kate takes us around to her
friends in the saloons and restaurants, and they rob
us. We go out with her because we can wear our best
clothes and look good and she shows us off to her
customers.

“Once in a while a girl gets so discouraged that she
runs out into the street in her wrapper, but she don’t
get out of the block. Some other landlady’s door is
open and she goes in hoping to get fairer treatment
and a chance to save part of the money she earns, but
it’s the same old thing. What the madam don’t get
goes to the doctors, druggists, hack drivers, and
messengers. All we get is enough to eat, enough to wear,
and plenty to drink if we’re foolish enough to go that
route. God only knows what becomes of these girls
when they get too old and ugly. They go down and
down from one place to another till they finally land
in the street, old, worn out, dissipated and diseased.
No man will have them. I guess they go to the river
or to the hospital.

“Bad as Miss Kate’s is, it is better than having to
trade yourself for a few shabby rags like I did. Miss
Kate won’t let drunken men come in and beat us and
abuse us. The men we meet don’t lie to us or deceive
us like they do out in the world. They come in and
look us over just like the butcher used to look at my
father’s fat hogs in the fall. We know what they
come for; they know we know. So there’s no lying
and deception and promising you a job. Of course
they will steal your money out of the bureau drawers
or your hair brush or a pair of garters or silk
stockings, but you soon learn to protect yourself.
Sometimes, when they get drunk, they give you a few dollars
for yourself, or lose it on the floor and you put your
foot on it. Sometimes a girl gets so in debt that she
steals a few dollars from the men to spend decently
when she can get out by herself.”

“Julia,” I asked, “did you take the hog man’s
money?”

“No,” she snapped, bristling. She lied bravely, and
I knew it, and respected her for it, somehow. It was
one of those lies you know to be a lie and yet believe.
The beauty of her lie was that she just let it go with
that plain, short “No!” She did not go into any long
explanations or excuses, or blame it on anybody else.
It was a perfect lie, any way you look at it.

She lied to me and made me like it. My mind was
much disturbed by this terrible story, so new to me,
and a hundred plans came into it for helping her, but
she seemed so independent, confident, and resourceful
that I hesitated.

She struck the table with her fist. “If I ever put
my foot out of that place again I’ll stay out. I was
foolish to go out to-day; it’s so much harder to go
back now, after all the fun we’ve had. If I had a
change of clothes I would stay away and try to get
a job and start over again. I’ve got to get out
of there while I’m young and strong enough to
work.”

“Don’t go back, Julia,” I advised. “Take my
money, get a room and a few clothes. I’ll help you
find a job. I know how. I have forty dollars saved up.
You take that and we will earn more. It’s at my room.
You wait here till I get it.”

“Sit down,” she said. “Sit down. Why, you poor
kid, I wouldn’t take your money on a bet. I’d rot
in Miss Kate’s first. Don’t you know you are the
only human being I’ve met since I left home that hasn’t
tried to do me some kind of dirt? I am going to start
in saving every nickel this week, and if I can find some
way to get a few clothes out of there I’ll kiss Miss
Kate’s good-by forever.”

Here was a chance for adventure. “I’ll take your
clothes out of there, Julia,” I could see myself going
into Miss Kate’s with my two rusty pistols and
demanding Julia’s clothes. I could see the madam blustering
and protesting, the girls all gathered around, myself
standing there, adamant.

“No excuses, madam, if you please. I want Julia’s
clothes and Julia.”

Nothing to it, simple!

“How are you going to do it?” Julia asked. “If
you went in there and tried to take them they would
throw you out.”

“Well, how can I do it? Any way you say.”

She thought a long time before she answered: “I
could tie them in a sheet and throw them out the
window into the alley, kid, to you.”

This wasn’t heroic enough to suit me, but it sounded
practical. I wanted to help her, so I consented.

“And how are you going to get away if I get your
clothes?”

She thought again. “This week, kid, you hunt up
some hack driver you can trust and tell him what you
want to do. You can have him in the alley with his
hack. I’ll throw the clothes out. You put them in the
hack. Then I’ll come downstairs, go out through the
kitchen, and over the back fence into the alley. Nobody
will pay any attention to me going out in my parlor
wrapper without a hat.

“Next Saturday when you come with your bill I’ll
see you in the hall and tell you what night to come
and what time.” Julia was herself again; all
animation, chattering like a sparrow. “It can’t fail, kid.
I can feel myself out of there already. All you have
to do is get a hack driver, a big, tough one that won’t
get scared and run away. That’s all settled, and it’s
time for me to get back to Miss Kate’s. It’s not so
hard to go now.”

Again she insisted on paying the bill. I said good
night in front of the restaurant. She shook hands
with me heartily, boyishly; her hand was hard, firm,
and her grip something to inspire confidence.
“Saturday,” she said, darting away.

I went home with my chest out, my shoulders up
in the air, and my head high. I thought of all my
heroes. No, I wouldn’t trade places with any of them.
Here was real work to do. I must find a hack driver,
“a big, tough one.”

Cocky McAllister was tough enough. A lean,
hungry pirate with a balky eye, who cruised about
my neighborhood with his spavined horses and rickety
hack.

I told him what I wanted.

“Never let it be said that I refused to help any
young feller get himself a girl and get up in the
world,” he declared. “Say when. I’ll be on the spot
an’ it won’t cost you a dime, either.”

Julia was waiting Saturday when I got to Madam
Kate’s.

“Did you get a driver, kid?”

“Yes.”

“Be in the alley to-morrow night at eight.”

I promised to be there. That night I found Cocky
and readied him up for Sunday evening. He showed
up on the minute, and we were in the alley by Madam
Kate’s early. Julia was waiting at the window and out
came the bundle. I threw it into the hack. A minute
later Cocky snatched her off the fence, leaving part of
her wrapper behind. More of it was streaming out of
the hack door as I slammed it and we drove away.

She wiped the powder and rouge off her face. “No
more of that stuff,” she said.

On the way back to my neighborhood she spotted
a “Housekeeping Rooms” sign in the window of a
dingy-looking house. She stopped the hack and put
some money in my hand. “Dash up there, kid, and
hire a room, anything that’s vacant.”

I secured a room quickly enough, came down, and
got her. Cocky followed with the bundle of clothes.
I lit the gas, Cocky threw the clothes on the bed.

“This is the dirtiest room I ever saw,” said Julia,
“but it’s better than Miss Kate’s, and it’s home to
me. Good night and many thinks. I’ll see you later,
kid.”

Back at the cigar store I treated Cocky to a good
smoke. “Kid,” he said, leering at me admiringly,
“you’ve got a gold mine; that dame’s a money-getter.
She’s young and healthy and good for years. Listen,
you put her right out on the street. Make her walk
the blocks. She’s workin’ for you then, an’ not the
landladies and landlords. Keep her away from the
other women. They’ll wise her up an’ you'll lose her,
or put her against hop an’ you’ll have a bum on your
hands. That’s all, now. Are you goin’ to start her
in to-night? The sooner the better.”

“No, Mac,” I was anxious to get away from him.
“She’s tired and nervous. I think I’ll let her rest
to-night.”

The police got Cocky that night. I never saw
him again. He never learned of my treason in
allowing Julia to stay off the streets.

She came into the cigar store a few days later,
beaming, happy. “I’ve got a job, kid, at the Comique
jerking beer. Not so good, but better than Miss
Kate’s. It will do till I get a better one. Come down
and watch me work.”

The Comique was an old-time collar-and-elbow
variety show long since supplanted by the modern
vaudeville show house. A dozen girls sold drinks to
the patrons on commission. A girl could live on her
commissions, but few of them did. I think Julia
managed to do it. I went down to see her and found her
bouncing with energy.

“I’ve made three dollars already to-night, kid, and
it’s all mine.”

I waited till she was ready to go home, and walked
with her. She had cleaned up the room till it looked
halfway decent. “You don’t have to go; the place
is as much yours as mine,” she said when I was
leaving. I didn’t think about her being a girl; I went home
because it was my habit. If she had been a boy I
would have done the same.

I was busy all the time learning to gamble at Tex’s,
collecting bills for the milkman, and taking Julia home
after work. There was no mention of her the next
time I went to Madam Singleton’s. She was forgotten,
and they never suspected me.

I was saving my money, hoping some day to get my
gray suit, hat, and trunk. I told Julia of my ambition
to have the suit and leather trunk.

“I’ll buy them for you, kid, as soon as I get a few 
things myself.”

“Never mind that, Julia, I’ll pay for them,” I said,
thinking of Cocky McAllister.

I hung around the Comique every night, waiting for
Julia. She knew all the “actors” and told me about
them.

The handsome young man who came out in a green
suit did a clog dance and sang “’Tis a handful of
earth” so feelingly worked daytimes in a near-by
chop-house. The two girls with skirts almost to their
knees that did the buck and wing dance sold beer in
the boxes. The comedians that beat and pummeled
each other about the stage starved around between
engagements at the local theaters. The strong man,
my favorite, turned out to be the bartender upstairs;
he also served as bouncer.

Julia was ambitious to make more money and every
night practiced dancing in hopes that she could some
time do a turn at the theater. I served as her audience,
sat around till the small hours, and often fell asleep
in a chair or on the bed. One night we hurried home
ahead of a storm and I was on the bed asleep before
she had her supper cooked. She woke me up tugging
at me. “Get up, you poor kid; take your clothes off
and go to bed if you’re that dead for sleep.” She
helped me take off my shoes and I was soon asleep
again. She went to bed without waking me, but as
I tossed about in the night I knew she was there and
was glad. Once my body touched hers—it was hot
and sticky. I pulled the sheet down between us and
turned away. The next morning as we were walking
to the restaurant for breakfast a heavy hand fell on
my shoulder; I turned to face my father.

My father’s hand was heavy on my shoulder as
he pushed me into a doorway. He looked sad and
his stern voice shook. “John, do you know what you
are? You are a pimp.”

Julia never stopped, never looked back, just kept
going, which was the right thing. She probably thought
I had been taken by the police. No good in her
getting arrested, too.

Although for years I kept a sharp eye out, I never
saw her again; that is, to know her. Of course the
gray-haired old lady that sat next me in the car this
morning might have been Julia. But anyway, if she
is alive and this meets her eye, I want her to know
I never doubted for a minute that she stayed away
from the life she left behind at Madam Singleton’s.

Later, when I went to her room, it was vacant.
The man in charge told me a strange, bearded
man with a policeman called on her—my father, no
doubt—after which she packed up and left without a
word.

I called at the theater and inquired, but they had
forgotten her.

## Chapter VI

As we walked to our boarding house I told my
father the whole story of my job in the cigar store,
my collecting for the milkman, my arrest, and our
rescue of Julia. He listened without comment, and
when I was done, said: “Well, John, you’ll be what
you’ll be, and I cannot help or hinder you. Go back
to your job in the morning if you like.”

Those were his last words to me. They were kind,
and I have always remembered them and their ring
of fatality. I never saw him again. I learned later
that he lived out his life orderly and died decently.
He went away the next day, and when he returned
I was far away, westbound in search of adventure.

I was tired of Tex and his tribe and their smoky
back room and cheap cheating. I was sick of the sight
of the crabby widow at the boarding house. It was
springtime. Sundown found me miles away on a
country road, walking westward. Yes, I was going
in the right direction. There was the sun going down
away off in front of me. Darkness was coming on,
but it did not strike me as unusual that I had no
supper or no room for the night.

I came to a bridge and stopped when I heard voices
below. I looked over the side and a voice came up:
“Come on down, kid. Don’t be leary, we’re only a
couple of harmless bindle stiffs.”

I picked my way down to the level place beside the
small creek where they were. One of them was
unrolling a “bindle” of blankets, the other was washing
a large tin can in the creek.

“Throw out your feet, kid, and get some wood
before it gets too dark. We’ll have a fire and a can
of Java, anyway.”

Wood was plentiful. I soon returned with an
armful. The other bum came up with the can from the
creek and began breaking up some twigs to start the
fire. He barely looked at me. “Take a look around
the jungle, kid, and see if you can find a pan,” he
ordered.

“What in hell do you want a pan for?” asked the
one that sent me after wood. “Are you going to fry
some water?” The other was on his hands and knees
blowing up the weak fire. He stood up and looked
at the speaker with a most superior air. “Not so
fast, brother, not so fast. I’ve got a gump in my
bindle.”

He unrolled his blankets and produced a live
chicken, big and fat.

The other bum was humbled. “A gump!” he
muttered, “and me carrying a fryin’ pan with me for the
last week.” He dived into his bindle and got
the pan.

The owner of the chicken took the pan and held it
between his eye and the fire looking for holes in it.
“It’ll do,” he said. “More wood, kid,” they both
ordered.

We were three strangers well met under the
bridge; one had a chicken, one coffee and a stale loaf
of bread. I had nimble legs and gathered the firewood.

The gump was picked, cleaned, unjointed, and put
in the pan with neatness and despatch that would have
done credit to any chef. The coffee boiled fragrantly
in the tin can. The owner of the stale loaf hacked it
into three equal parts with his strong pocketknife,
while the chicken man deftly turned sections of the
bird with a sharp-pointed stick.

“This is a pretty snide jungle,” he said, “no cans.
Throw your feet, kid, and get some cans for the
Java.”

I scurried around and was lucky to find one small
can in the dark. The cook inspected it. “Go down
and wash it, bring it back half full of water an’ I’ll
boil it out.”

I washed the can and brought it back. The chicken
and coffee were cooked and cooling near the fire. The
cook scalded out the small can and filled it with coffee.
He held out the pan of chicken to the other bum and
then to me, helping himself to a piece last. The small
can of coffee was now cool enough to drink, and was
handed around in the same order. The first bum took
several swallows and passed it to me. I handed it
to the cook without drinking any. He looked at me
for the first time.

“Say, brat, listen. If you was some kind of a rank
dingbat you wouldn’t have been invited down here.
Don’t think because you couldn’t hustle a can that
you ain’t entitled to your coffee.”

“You’re right at that, Jack,” said the bum that
furnished the coffee. “Go ahead, kid.”

I drank my coffee and passed the can along. We
ate in silence. The chicken and bread soon
disappeared. My companions lit up their pipes and
smoked while we finished the coffee.

I was learning fast. I took the frying pan, filled it
with water, and put it on the fire, without waiting for
orders. When the water boiled I washed it at the
creek, scrubbed it with sand, and returned it to the
owner.

“Where you from, kid?”

“The city,” I answered.

“How long you been on the road?”

“This is my first day.”

“Got any people?”

“No, they are all dead.”

“Where you goin’?”

“Oh, just west, anywhere, everywhere.”

“Got any pennies?”

“No pennies. I’ve got a couple of dollars.” I
looked from one to the other. “Do you want any
of it, either of you?”

“No,” from both of them. “But,” said the cook,
“if we was in the city I’d take fifty cents of it purty
pronto and get myself a four-bit micky.”

“A what?” I asked, mystified.

“A four-bit micky, a fifty-cent bottle of
alcohol—Dr. Hall, white line,” he translated in disgust. “If
you’re goin’ west you better learn to talk west.”

“Yes,” said the other, “and ‘pennies’ don’t mean
pennies. It means money, on the road.”

They didn’t talk much between themselves; they
had probably compared notes before I arrived at the
bridge. They were both past fifty, wore clean overalls,
substantial shoes, and clean-looking blue shirts. A
month later I could have classified them correctly as
professional bums, too old to ride the trains, satisfied
to throw their feet along the “star routes,” or country
roads, where food was seldom refused, and to sleep
in their bindles, or blankets, under the stars.

It was time to “flop.” They took off their shoes
and coats. The shoes were neatly placed together on
a level spot; the coat was folded and placed on top
of them making a fair pillow, and at the same time
protecting them from theft. Each of them threw me
a piece of blanket. I made a pillow of my coat and
shoes, rolled up in the blankets, and was soon asleep.

A farmer’s team crossing the bridge woke us at
daylight. I got up at once, cold and sore from the
hard ground, and made a fire. The other two crawled
out of their blankets and went down to the creek to
wash. I followed them. They both had soap wrapped
in paper. One of them gave me his piece. I washed
and returned it. He placed it on a rock till it was
dry, then wrapped it up and put it in his coat pocket.
They also had pocket combs and small round mirrors.

We went back to the fire and discussed breakfast.
“Nothing but Java,” said the bum that had the coffee.

“I’ll go to the farmhouse,” I volunteered, “and buy
something.”

“Nix, nix,” said one; “buy nothin’,” said the other,
“it’s you kind of cats that make it tough on us, buyin’
chuck. They begin to expect money. You go up to
that house,” pointing to a place on a small rise, about
fifteen minutes’ walk, “and tell the woman you and two
other kids run away from home in the city three days
ago and you ain’t had nothin’ but a head of cabbage
that fell off a farmer’s wagon between youse since you
left. Tell her you are on your way back home and
the other two kids are down by the bridge so hungry
they can’t walk. On your way up there git a phony
name and street number ready in case she asks you
questions. She’ll give you a sit-down for yourself,
chances are, but bring back a ‘lump’ for us. You’re
a decent-lookin’ kid; she might git worked up about
your troubles and ask a lot of dam’ fool questions.
Cut her off. Tell her you’re ashamed to be settin’
there wasting time and the other boys starvin’ under
the bridge.”

Before I got to the house a couple of dogs dashed
out, barking savagely. A healthy, matronly woman
came out and quieted them, looking at me inquiringly.
I told her myself and two boy friends, runaways from
home, were hungry and I wanted some food, that I
would be glad to pay her for anything she could spare,
and if she would wrap it up I would hurry down to
the bridge with it, where my chums were waiting.

“Yes,” she said kindly, “come in. I haven’t much
here, but maybe I can find enough.” She gave me a
seat outside near the kitchen door, where I waited
and made friends with the dogs. In no time she came
out with a large parcel, and refused the money I
offered. I thanked her and went down to the bridge
with my “lump.”

The bums had coffee boiling. We found enough tin
cans to drink from and opened the parcel. It contained
cold, fried chicken, cold biscuits, and half a pie.

“You’re a good connecter, kid; sure you didn’t pay
for this?” one of them said.

“No, and I didn’t have to answer any questions.
It was easy except for the dogs.”

“Don’t let dogs worry you, kid; they’re cowards.
I ought to know, I’ve been battlin’ ’em twenty
years. They’ll bite you if you turn your back or run
away, or if there’s a pack of ’em they’ll pull you
down. If you get up against a hostile dog, rush him
and he’ll weaken. I never got bit but once an’ that
was in the town of Pueblo. I was just after gettin’
a six months’ floater out of Denver an’ went down to
Pueblo to do a little D.D.ing with lavender for myself.
I got myself a bunch of lavender and a ducat.”

The other bum laughed, his mouth full of chicken.
“You’re talkin’ Chinook to that kid. What does he
know about the D.D. and lavender and ducats.”

“You’re right,” I said. “I don’t know what he is
talking about.” I was anxious to learn, but didn’t
like to ask questions.

“Well, it’s this way,” he went on. “I was
dummyin’ up, see? Imitatin’ a deaf an’ dumb man. D.D.ing,
see? You surely know what lavender is—stuff women
put on clothes. You put about a spoonful in a small
envelope. You’ve got a pocketful of the envelopes
ready when you go out to make your ‘plunge.’ Then
you get your ducat, see? That’s the main thing. I
got a bartender to write it for me on the back of a
lawyer’s card. When the women opens the door you
slip her your ducat and she reads:

> ‘I am deaf and dumb. I got hurt by a street
> car and just came out of the county hospital.
> I am trying to get seven dollars to pay my fare
> home to Cheyenne. Please take a parcel of
> lavender and give what you can.’

Sometimes they take your lavender an’ sometimes they
don’t, but they generally give up something, an’ they
can’t ask you a lot of questions, and if a copper grabs
you you’ve got an out. You ain’t exactly beggin’.

“As I was sayin’ about dogs. I was battering the
privates, see? Private houses. A woman had just
slipped me a dime an’ was standin’ in the front door
watchin’ to see that I got off the premises. I’m about
halfway to the gate when I heard a dog snarlin’, an’
comin’ up behind me. I’m D.D., see, an’ don’t want
to round on the damn dog an’ give myself a bawl-out
in front of the woman, so I stand my ground figgerin’
she’ll stop him. The next thing I know he’s got half
my pants leg ripped off an’ a chunk out of one of my
shins. Anyway, I run him under the house. The
woman took me in an’ fixed me up with arnica an’ a
bandage. Then she gets me a good suit of her old
man’s clothes, gives me two dollars, and holds the
dog under the house till I get out the front gate.
That’s dogs for you,” he finished, “an’ women.”

I had a question, but the other bum asked it for me.
“What do you do if you bump into a natural dummy
when you’re D.D.ing?”

“Well,” said the dog expert, “I never bumped into
one, but if I did I suppose I’d do what everybody else
does when they’re wrong an’ get caught at it. I’d get
mad an’ cuss hell out of ’em.”

Breakfast over, the bums shaved. Both had razors.
All bums carry razors for shaving, fighting, or cutting
through a sleeper’s clothing to get into his pocket. One
of them had a big silk handkerchief that he stropped
his razor on, the other used his belt. They heated
water in a tin can, lathered their hands, and rubbed
it on their faces. One used his mirror, the other used
none. After shaving they dried their blades carefully
and secreted them about their persons. Blankets were
rolled up, and the bums were ready to take the road.
The D.D. man was going into the city for a few days.
“So long.” He scrambled up the bank to the road.

The other was traveling in my direction and
volunteered to direct me to a junction where I could make
a westbound train.

“You’re welcome to travel with me, kid, if you
want to jungle-up for a month or two,” my companion
said. “The fruit will be gettin’ ripe soon, and there’ll
be green corn and new spuds and the gumps are fat
already. I promise myself some famous mulligans
around these parts.”

Many boys would have jumped at this chance, but
I declined. Maybe it was a dislike for begging, or
ambition, or my imagination pulling me westward.
I don’t know; but it wasn’t the hardships, I’m sure.
At the junction we parted.

“So long, kid. May see you out West next fall
when I make the poultice route.”

“What’s that?” I asked.

“That’s southern Utah, kid, the land of milk and
honey. You’re always sure of a big pan of milk and
a fresh loaf of home bread—the poultice route, see? 
So long.”

A long, heavy westbound freight train was slowly
pulling out when I got to the railroad yards. A car
of lumber, clean and white, piled halfway to the roof,
the door invitingly open, came along. Nimbly I swung
up and in.

Inside the car I looked about for a place to secrete
myself. The lumber was about six feet shorter than
the car, which left a large space at one end. I dropped
down into it, took off my coat, and stretched out on
the floor, feeling sure of a long ride. No brakeman
would crawl over that pile of lumber even if he knew
there was a hiding place at one end.

Along in the afternoon, after one of the many
stops, I heard a scrambling above and a young fellow
about my own age dropped lightly down beside me.
I had been in the car so long that the half light was
enough. I saw he was ragged and frightfully dirty,
road dirt—coal smoke, cinders, ashes, grease. His
coat, too large for the thin frame, was full of holes
and its lining hung in tatters. His trousers were
greasy and full of hot-cinder holes. His calico shirt
was open in front, his skin was dirty. He was
sharp-eyed and thin-faced. He eyed me wolfishly.

“How long you been here?”

“All day.”

“Where you headin’ for?”

“Denver.”

“Got a smoke?”

“No.”

He dug a dirty newspaper out of his back pocket,
neatly tore a piece off the border, tearing it downward
with the grain, till he had a piece the size of a
cigarette paper. A search of his coat pocket yielded a cigar
snipe, which he crushed in his hand and then rolled up
in the paper he had held in his mouth.

“Got a match?”

“No.”

He looked at me in disgust, dug up one of his own,
and lit up. The smell of his cigarette was fierce. He
now took off his shoes. One of them was laced with
dirty white string. He had no socks, his feet were
grimy and smelled. His coat came off next; with
it and his shoes he made a pillow and stretched out on
the floor.

“Won’t the brakeman smell that smoke?” I asked.

“To hell with him an’ you,” and he spoke no more.
Finishing his smoke, he adjusted his pillow and went
to sleep. I rolled my coat up, made a pillow, and
dozed. I was afraid he would steal my shoes, so I left
them on.

Something woke me in the evening. I think it was
the lumber shifting. The train was on a down grade,
the car creaking and rocking. We were in the front
end. Suddenly my companion jumped to his feet. He
looked scared, started to crawl up on top of the
lumber. He was too late. There was a grinding noise,
and a crash. About four feet of the top of the lumber
slid forward against the front end of the car and he
was crushed, flattened between. I was a prisoner
below, unhurt. This shifting of the lumber cut off
the light from the open side door, but its weight
against the end of the car opened up some cracks and
I was soon able to see about me dimly. The boy had
died instantly. His body, from the waist up, was
flattened between the lumber and front end of the
car. His legs dangled below, down where I was
imprisoned, with each movement of the car, like the legs
of a scarecrow in the wind.

I can’t remember that I was shocked or frightened,
but I do know that as soon as I found I was imprisoned
in that car I got hungry. I hadn’t eaten since
morning and was hungry before the thing happened. But
then I knew I could get out and eat at any stop. Now
I couldn’t, and my hunger became unbearable.

The place I was in was large as ever, except in
height. The shifting of the lumber had reduced that
to about three feet. I couldn’t stand up. I was in no
danger. The lumber could not shift at the bottom,
the weight of that above was too heavy. I had a
strong pocketknife, and went to work on the side of
the car near the end. The boarding was thin,
weather-rotten, and old. In a couple of hours I had cut
almost through one end of three boards. My hands
were blistered. I sat down and waited till I heard
the whistle blow for a town.

As the train went into the yards I kicked the boards
loose at the top where they were cut, and pulled them
away from below where they were nailed. This gave
me a hole large enough to crawl out of, which I did,
feet first, pulling my coat after, when she stopped. Up
on the main street I learned I was in Dodge City,
Kansas, a town at that time largely given over to
gambling, fighting, and whisky drinking. I wasn’t
interested in any of those amusements then. I got
something to eat and went to a cheap room for the night.
Tired out, I slept till noon the next day. Then I went
down to the yards to look for another train out. Near
the depot I met a character who looked like a bum.
He gave me a sharp look.

“Goin’ down in the yards, young feller?”

“Yes, why?” 

“Better wait till night if you want to make a train.
The railroad bull is hostile. They found a bum dead
in a car of lumber this morning, and they had to tear
the end of the car off to get his body out. He must
have been an awful gay cat to get into the end of a
carload of planed lumber. It’s suicide.”

I went back uptown and into a lunch counter. The
waiter was idle and talkative.

“Traveling?” he asked.

“Yes.”

“Which way?”

“Denver.”

“Beating it?”

“Yes.”

“Listen here, it’ll take you three or four days to
make Denver that way. You’ll ruin your clothes and
maybe get grabbed off a train and handed thirty days
at Colorado Springs—big chain gang there—they’re
cleaning up the streets. If you can dig up five
dollars I’ll give you a card to a porter on the
Overland to-night. Give him the five and he’ll do
the rest.”

“Thanks, I’ll try it.”

I met the train and the porter who took the card
and my five dollars, stowed me away in the linen closet,
and locked the door. I was almost suffocated. Once
in the night he opened the closet. “How you makin’
out, buddy?”

“All right,” I said, and the door was locked again.
Next morning he gave me a piece of steak between
slices of bread, and a bottle of coffee. After that I
felt better and dozed in a cramped, sitting position in
a corner.

That afternoon at Denver I was released, happy,
hungry, cramped, and tired. I rented a cheap room
for a week, went to a barber shop, and had a bath.
I thought twenty-five cents for a bath a rank waste of
money and decided to find a swimming hole. In a
few days I found one.

There was a sort of camp for bums on the river
bank under some trees. They had their fires there,
and cans for boiling coffee. They used to lie around,
washing and boiling their clothes, and swimming. They
stole chickens around the neighborhood and anything
else they could get.

One afternoon I was in swimming, when suddenly
there was an alarm and everybody ran. I didn’t pay
any attention to it at first; then I got out of the water
and ran for my clothes. I had just about got them on
when the police arrived and grabbed me.

They put me into the patrol wagon. I was the only
one they got. Later they picked up one or two others
around in the woods, and took us all down to the jail.
I was scared half to death.

They put us all in one big room with a lot of other
bums they’d picked up. The police had had a
general order to clean up the town.

In the morning they took us all up to court. It
was the first time I had been in court. We were all
charged with vagrancy. When my name was called, I
protested. I said, “Judge, you can’t call me a vagrant.
I have twenty dollars down in the jail office.”

He looked at me as coldly and impersonally as if
I had been a dish of parsnips. “Fifteen days on the
chain gang. Next case.”
